			Donald Trump: (00:13)
Hello, Iowa. Congratulations to the Iowa hawkers. That was a big win today. I’m thrilled to be back. That was a big win. But I am thrilled to be back especially on such great news as that, that was a big one. You’ve been a great school, a great team, a great tradition, really an amazing job and it all started right here and we’re going to keep it here. Number one, right? We’re going to keep it here. The fairgrounds so they broke the record tonight in the history of the fairgrounds. I don’t know how old it is, but in the history of the fairgrounds, this is the most people they’ve had. So thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:00)
And all of you who are hard working American Patriots that we know and we love you all, as we get there tonight, millions of Americans are realizing that Joe Biden and the radical left have brought our nation to the brink of ruin. There’s never been anything like what has happened. After just nine months under Biden, violent criminals and blood thirsty gangs are taking over our streets, illegal aliens and deadly drug cartels are taking over our borders. Inflation is taking over our economy. China is taking over our jobs. The Taliban has taken over Afghanistan. Lunatic leftists are taking over our schools and radical socialists are taking over our country. And we’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to let that happen. And you can’t say I didn’t warn you, but I also can’t say you didn’t get out because you got out and voted like no sitting president has ever received votes before. The election was rigged. But as disastrous as the Biden administration has been, no one can blame the great State of Iowa because, boy, we did really, we did really good here.
Donald Trump: (02:24)
Iowa, what a place? And by the way, nobody’s ever been better to Iowa and the farmers than Trump. I can tell you that. You know that. You know that. First you rejected Joe Biden by delivering him a humiliating fourth place finish in the Iowa caucuses. You remember that? He came out, he didn’t even stick around, he left. Then you came out in record numbers to give us thundering eight point landslide victory, a big beautiful victory in November. You proved why Iowa should continue to vote first in the nation. That’s right. First in the nation. And Jeff understands that. Right, Jeff? First in the nation, Jeff. And just this week, the latest the Boyne register poll showed that Biden is at a record low 31% approval in Iowa. Who the hell are the 31%? Is there anybody here that voted? Any 31 percenters? While your all time favorite president. This is a negative poll for Trump. I mean, they don’t like me too much but we can’t complain, I guess. Is that a record high we’re right now at a highest we’ve ever been, 53% approval. Which for radical left newspaper is not bad, right? You saw some of those polls. Texas is in play. We won by a lot. Florida is in play. We won by a lot. Ohio is in play. We won by a lot. He’s down 17 points in the state of Wisconsin and actually we won by a lot. Twice.
Donald Trump: (04:26)
Remember last time they had us down 19 points in Wisconsin and we won. I said, why is that? Why do they do that? Because they want to keep people from going and voting. It’s called suppression. They’re suppression polls, they should be illegal, but basically it’s the fake news. “Oh, you have a lot of people there.” Fake news. It’s the fake news. As we speak, Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats in Congress are trying to ramp through a $5 trillion world spending bills that cost more than the entire sum the United States has spent two on any war in the history of our country. Not only is this the largest spending bill of all time and the largest tax hike of all time, this monstrosity is so dangerous for our country and so bad for children and grandchildren to come. This monstrosity is a bill to end America as we know it. It’s so bad. And the Republicans have to stay strong. You have to stay strong. You have to fight. Bring our country back.
Donald Trump: (05:37)
It’s a socialist transformation bill. It’s an open borders bill. It’s an American energy destruction bill. First time ever we had energy independence ever. Now they’re calling OPEC, Russia and other countries, “Please send us some oil, will you please?” We were finished with that. We had more by far. When I left office, we had more energy, we had more coming in, we had more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia by far, than Russia by far and now what calling them asking if they’d help out. In Alaska they killed Anwar. They’ve been trying to get it since Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it. Couldn’t get it. And I got it. [inaudible 00:06:24].
Donald Trump: (06:27)
For many, many years, for decades, and now perhaps the biggest drilling site anywhere in the world as big as Saudi Arabia, now you know what they did? They terminated it. Lisa Murkowski Republican did a really bad job for the state of Alaska. That I can tell you. It’s an illegal race-based discrimination bill. It’s a corrupt elections bill. Oh, wait till you look at what they have about your elections like the elections aren’t bad enough and corrupt enough. It’s a bankrupt Medicare bill. It’s a bankrupt social security bill. They’ll bankrupt both of them. And it’s a naked power grab by the likes of Biden and Pelosi and Kamala Harris. Hasn’t she done a great job with the border?
Donald Trump: (07:14)
And Bernie Sanders is in there too. And Omar. How about Omar? Omar. Omar is in there too. She doesn’t like Israel too much. Does she, huh? Didn’t she marry her brother, right? She came in she married her brother just nice. And they don’t do anything about it. They don’t do anything about it. With us they do everything, right? Oh, they do everything. Congressional Republicans must stand strong. This is not a time for Republicans to fall, to walk away, to quit, to be afraid. Whatever happens happens. They have to be strong. Don’t worry about being impeached. Don’t worry about anything. You’re worried one of them was so worried he was going to be impeached. He let everything happen. It was so sad to watch. I watched it. It was really pretty sad. But they just don’t seem to have the spine, some of them.
Donald Trump: (08:18)
Thank you. That was a great word. That’s the word I was looking for. You need spine. Here are just some of the ugly surprises hidden in the Democrats socialists calamity. According to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, the Biden spending bill will raise taxes on working families like never ever before. The Biden plan would make the United States business tax rate dramatically higher and bring it back to one of the highest in the world and actually substantially higher than a place called communist China. Have you ever heard of it? In fact, taking into account all taxes under Biden’s plan, the Democrat bill would give businesses an approximately 100% tax advantages to locate jobs in China rather than the United States. Think of it.
Donald Trump: (09:21)
We’re incentivizing people to go to China but not here. Gee, I wonder why. The Biden plan will build up China and the Republican party we want to build up America. Very simple. Biden socialists bill also includes mass amnesty and free college. Don’t get excited for illegal aliens. Not for you, but for illegal aliens. It includes a blow out increase in chain migration and it eliminates caps on green cards for foreign workers. Lots of luck. By the way, we have created more jobs than ever before. We have, we have 12 months ago, we had 160 million people working in this country. The highest number by far. African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, men, graduates of the top colleges and universities, non-graduates, people that didn’t have a high school education, never got a diploma, every single group had the highest numbers they’ve ever had. Hundreds of thousands of people are right now pouring into the United States from Haiti. The people coming into our country are uneducated. In many cases, don’t speak the language. They don’t have the skills that we need to make America great again. Have you ever heard that expression? And they’ve been for many, many years, sadly they’ve been unemployed. The Democrat bill will also admit every foreign national previously denied under my national security travel ban. Remember I had the travel ban? Everyone said, “Oh, what a horrible thing.” I said, “No, we really don’t want people in our country who are going to blow up our cities, if you don’t mind.” We don’t want. We don’t want fifth avenue blown up. They’re having enough time with crime on fifth avenue right now and Chicago and lots of other places. We won in the United States Supreme court for the travel ban, bringing in countless unscreened travelers from all over terror afflicted countries and they weren’t allowed to come in. We said we don’t, I’m sorry, we want to be politically correct. We want to be nice. I’m sorry. We don’t want people that want to hurt our people, that want to hurt our country. I think that’s okay. It will include funding for unlimited numbers of unvetted African nationals to be brought to America and given free welfare and government benefits courtesy of you, the people of Iowa and the American taxpayer. Congratulations. I’m sure you’re thrilled about it. As you have to struggle. And only 3% of the people they crammed into those planes, remember they said, ” Oh, the airlift was… Oh, that was scrape.” They had no idea who was getting on those planes. We still don’t have any idea. Only 3% were qualified to be taken to a place called the United States of America. Isn’t that something? 3%. You’re going to be hearing from those people over the coming years in a very bad way, right? The Democrat package includes a plan to demolish the US energy industry which has largely been done in a period of nine months, starting with a $630 billion down payment on the socialist green new deal, which is throwing money out the window at the expense of future generations of Americans. The green new deal conceived and made up at about 15 minutes by some radicals sitting around in a room that know nothing about the environment.
Donald Trump: (13:27)
Their bill includes giant new taxes and fees and American oil. And especially on American gas production that will kill capitalists oil and gas jobs, devastating workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and many, many other states. Gas prices and inflation have already skyrocket. I saw the other day inflations are highest in 24 years. Think of it. But it’s going to go up and much more. Get ready. The Democrat bill imposes a new energy tax on methane which is projected to increase your energy costs by hundreds of dollars per year, percentages that nobody even knows what to say. Up 50, 60, 70, and 80% quickly. The bill abolishes the Hyde Amendment forcing taxpayers to fund the far left extreme abortion agenda, ripping babies from their mother’s womb right up until the moment of birth. And in fact killing babies even after birth. You saw that in Virginia with the governor of Virginia after birth. In the Republican party we believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Donald Trump: (14:55)
The Democrat socialist bill also includes a $1.3 billion payoff to the fake news industry, these people, but we’re giving them money. They don’t deserve it. By subsidizing and hiring of reporters at media outlets all across the country, meaning, liberal media outlets. Can you imagine on top of everything else, billions of dollars is being spent to take care of these people that don’t report truth. They don’t report truth. They’re all going out, right now they’re going to buy a new car. Nice one too. Meanwhile, the media says nothing about Biden’s handling of COVID despite all of the vaccines that we came up with, therapeutics that we came up, and knowledge that we gave Biden’s come up with this horrible period of time. He hasn’t done the job because now we have more people that have died of COVID in 2021 with the vaccines, with the therapeutics, more people died in 2021 than in all of 2020. But the media is silent. They don’t talk about that. They hate to talk about that. Can you imagine if I were president and had these numbers and some people thought, first of all, he didn’t get elected. Okay. Forget that. But some people said, “Oh sir, it was COVID.”
Donald Trump: (16:34)
Incredible. They’re allowed to say that about me. They called it illegitimate, they called it everything in the book, it was fine when I say it. Now here’s the difference, Hillary conceded. I never conceded. Never. Never conceded. No reason to concede. When you look at the numbers of these swing states, and we’re going to go over them real quickly in a little while, but when you hear these numbers of swing states, there was no reason to concede. They shouldn’t have conceded. They did the honest thing, attacking our country. Even though the numbers are greater, they don’t have the death watch in the right hand corner. Remember on CNN fake news which is down 80% in ratings.
Donald Trump: (17:24)
Remember that death watch. Death watch. And the [inaudible 00:17:33], we don’t have that anymore, but they’re losing more people. Okay? What’s going on? That doesn’t sound so good. That’s because it’s fake news. They are the enemy of the people. The Democrat bill contains billions and billions of dollars for unlawful government training programs inspired by toxic and bigoted and critical race theory. It’s crammed with so-called equity provisions. Equity. You know what equity means? We’re going to take it away from you and give it to other people. I don’t think they’re going to take it away from too many of you. I have a feeling. I don’t think they’re going to take it away from you. But it’s a code word for illegal government discrimination that they want to bring to everything from education, to housing, to healthcare, to our military.
Donald Trump: (18:26)
They’re also giving the IRS the power to destroy people, just like they tried to do with the Tea Party, Christian organizations. And just like they’ve always been trying to do to me, yeah, you see that. We fight like hell. We all fight like hell. This bill is a sinister combination of job, killing tax hikes and walk fascism that will destroy our nation. And to think that we had 11 Republicans go along with an extension, headed up by Mitch McConnell. Can you believe that? Mitch McConnell. 11… And you know what it does? It gives the Democrats more time, two months. It gives them more time to figure it out. They can now have two more months to figure out how to screw us. That’s what they did. They approved it. And they should be ashamed of themselves.
Donald Trump: (19:27)
The radical Democrats will lower the final price tag to try to fool the public. They’ll come in and, “Oh, we don’t want the five.” Because it’s truly five, it’s not three and a half. Also, it’s not an infrastructure bill. It’s 9% infrastructure. The rest is a green new deal garbage that you might as well just throw it out, put it in the wastepaper basket. But think of it, trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars more than anybody’s ever even conceived of. Most of it for junk programs that will only hurt our country.
Donald Trump: (20:02)
But the bottom line will always be a socialist transformation of America if they allow this to happen. So when they talk about the debt ceiling, we have a very powerful card there. We don’t want to violate that, but that’s more important than what they’re going to do by passing this thing that’s going to kill our nation. All Americans have common sense. Republican, Democrat and independent must stand firm. And you have to really stand strong and firm against Biden, crazy Nancy Pelosi, she’s a nut job, and the extreme power grab.
Donald Trump: (20:45)
And we must declare with one united voice that we cannot allow America to ever become a socialist country. That’s what they’re doing. And I really think it’s a step beyond, I think this is going to be a communist country. We’re not letting it happen. But these people, the media who don’t cover anything they do that’s wrong, anything they do that’s okay they make it like it’s the greatest thing that ever happened, and anything we do that’s right they make it sound bad, evil and corrupt. They are sick people and they’re really hurting our country. Practically every single Democrat lawmaker, the house and Senate has endorsed this deranged legislation, and that’s why every single one of them has to be voted out of office next November. Next November, it’s coming up quick. Time flies, right? Time flies.
Donald Trump: (21:41)
Remember the election we said, “Oh boy, it will never end. It’s just it.” But let’s say, in November we have an election already. I mean, think of it. It’s a year from now we’re having an election so quickly it flies. The four years really flew. I did a couple of things. I said, I have two things. Number one is to protect and save our country. And the other thing was to survive against these maniacs. We must send the radical left a message. They will never, ever forget. And we must do it by electing record numbers of America first Republicans. And we have a lot of great ones.
Donald Trump: (22:22)
We have so many great ones. The Democrats multi-trillion dollar spending spree is also going to trigger runaway inflation. And last month we saw yet another dismal jobs report came out yesterday. Did you see those numbers? They were disaster. In fact, even the radical left newscast is oh, I think we’re looking at six or 700,000. What are you thinking about? I like 700,000. I think it’s 800,000. How about like really less than 200,000. They’re saying like, “Whoa, this has been.” And 10 minutes later, “Well, it’s not that bad actually, it’s pretty good.” These people are so corrupt. The media, look, I don’t need to do this. But the media is corrupt. And you know what? When I started, I’m so proud of this. Two things I proved. Number one, the elections are totally corrupt in our country. They have been for a long time. But never like they were this last time. They used COVID in order to cheat and rig.
Donald Trump: (23:21)
And the other thing is how dishonest the media was because they were at 96% approval rating before I came along, and now they’re like in what? The 20s. They’re actually, I think lower than Congress. Is that possible?
Audience: (23:38)
No.
Donald Trump: (23:38)
We’re going to witness a deadly combination of no growth and inflation, or what is known as stagflation. You remember stagflation from the years of Jimmy Carter. That’s very good. Well, let me show what you, oh. She’s a historian. Jimmy Carter, stagflation, they were not good years. I was in business. I was saying, “This isn’t good.” It was a bad time for our country, but this will be far worse because the numbers are far bigger. Under my administration we had the exact opposite. We had low inflation, surging growth, and the greatest jobs presidency in the history of our country. And I say that [inaudible 00:24:27].
Audience: (24:26)
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Donald Trump: (24:52)
I keep looking at these big, beautiful screens who else is going to give you a big screen like that? By the way, we have great generals but not the television guys. These guys are major losers. But do you think that general George Patton would have left early out of Afghanistan? Do you think he would have left dead soldiers for no reason whatsoever? And do you think he would have left $85 billion worth of the best equipment anywhere in the world? And you know Russia and China, they already have samples of our great helicopters. We have the Apache helicopter. We have the best stuff in the world, and they are now re-engineering the equipment, they’re de engineering, they’re taking it apart, they’re figuring it out and very soon they’ll be building the best stuff for less money. It’s a disgrace. What’s happened is a disgrace. Think of it. 600,000 of the best machine guns, rifles, and guns made anywhere in the world. And I read the other day, these tremendous numbers-
Donald Trump: (26:03)
And I read the other day, there’s tremendous numbers of our equipment right now, being sold on the black market. Isn’t that nice? General George Patton … I saw that movie years ago. And a little while ago, we were at a rally, and it was a great rally. And I said, “Could you guys ever find that opening to George Patton?” Right? What a great thing that was. George C. Scott, George C. Scott. I don’t know. Did he win the Academy Award? Did the movie? I think so. Something like that. They did pretty well. Right? But that was him. In fact, they actually said that wasn’t nearly as tough as the real Patton. That was a softer version of the real Patton, but we need that. We did great. We knocked out a 100% of the ISIS caliphate.
Donald Trump: (26:50)
We had great generals. We had a general named Cain. I went to Iraq. I don’t want to embarrass him, because he’s not a television general. I’ll end up ruining him. He’ll probably come out with a bad statement about me, because he was told to. But we had a general. I flew in, and I landed at night. Every window was dark, because they thought it would be … This is on Air Force One. I said, “Isn’t that terrible?” The lights were all off. They pulled down the shades. The plane was entirely black. They couldn’t see it. And I said, “Isn’t that incredible? We’ve spent trillions of dollars in the Middle East, and we can’t even land Air Force One with the lights on.” But I landed. And it was an incredible experience. I got to meet a lot of great real people, real soldiers, real generals, real officers. We have great generals.
Donald Trump: (27:40)
And I said to them … They greeted me at the airplane, immediately whisked me inside. I’m saying, “You mean with all the money we spent … ” But I met two generals that could star in any movie. They had that quality. And the sergeant, who was unbelievable, could have been a movie star. I said, “You’re a good looking guy. You’re a tough guy.” “Yes, sir.” But I met general … I said, “General Cain, what’s your first name?” “Raisin, sir. Raisin.” I said, “You mean like a raisin?” “Yes, sir.” I said, “You mean, your name is general Raisin Cain? I love you, general. You’re what I’m looking for. I’m looking for that.” And I said, “So, general, they say it’s going to take two years, general, to get rid of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq, Syria. And do you agree with that?” “No, sir.” I said, “You don’t? Well, my Washington television general said two years, and they said we won’t be able to do it in the … ” “I disagree, sir.”
Donald Trump: (28:46)
I said, “How long will it take?” “Sir, we can do it in four weeks. Maybe less, sir.” I said, “Wait a minute, general, explain this to me.” “Well, sir, they would come here and there of a higher rank.” I said, “Did you ever tell them what you have in mind?” “No, sir. That wasn’t my job. I’m a general. I was at a lower rank. They tell me, sir. They didn’t ask. I’m not supposed to do that, sir. I’d like to, and I wanted to, but I couldn’t.”
Donald Trump: (29:14)
I said, “So you did a plan that they didn’t want. Right? That’s what you want to do now.” He said, “Yes, sir. It’s very easy.” I said, “When you say four weeks,” Said, “Yes, sir, four weeks. And you know what? We’re going to have time left over, sir.” I said, “So what’s different? They say two years, and you won’t do it. You say four weeks, and you’re going to have time left over. What’s the difference?” “Sir, we’d hit them from five different locations. We’ll hit him from the left. We’ll hit him from the right. We’ll hit him down the middle. We’ll be launching from Syria, from Iraq and from all over. Sir, they only wanted us to fly from this big air force base that we have right here, from our big base. And we’re very far away, and it’s one location. Sir, we have many locations and we’ll hit them from every damn one of those locations.”
Donald Trump: (30:08)
And you know what? I said, “Well, let me give that a little thought, general.” I went back, and I listened to the other ones. And I said, “They’re not good.” One of them, Milley, actually told me that when we leave, he … I know where this came from. He went to Biden. I know exactly where this came from, because he told me the same thing, Milley, a real genius. I put the Patton thing up. Compare that to Milley. But he said to me the same thing as they did, “Sir, it’s cheaper to leave the equipment than it is to take it.” I said, “Now wait a minute,” and especially being in the construction business, right? I said, “So you mean we have a $50 million plane?” All it needs is a tank of gas and a pilot.
Donald Trump: (30:52)
We could have flown over 200 pilots, taken everything out. But we didn’t have to worry, because the Taliban listened to me. We didn’t have one soldier killed, think of it, in 18 months. I spoke to Abdul. Abdul is the man running the Taliban right now. They left us alone. And it would’ve been fine, but what happened is we took all our soldiers out. And I told this one time before to our great group of people, very much like you, from a slightly different state. Remember, Biden went to say, “It’s great to be in Idaho.” They said, “Sir, you’re in Iowa.” Do you remember that? ” It’s wonderful to be in New Hampshire.” “Sir. You’re in Florida.” So we should have known.
Donald Trump: (31:36)
But I know exactly what happened. Milley went up to him, just like he did to me. But it was unacceptable. With me, “I said, I want every nut. I want every bolt. I want every screw. I want every plane and tank. I want the Apaches. I want everything out. And I even want the hangers.” Those beautiful canvas hangers that hold these big monster planes. They’re massive. I said, “I want the hangers. I want the canvas. I want the plastic. I want the fiberglass. And I want the steel. I want everything out. And then we’re going to bomb the hell out of the five or so bases that we don’t want.”
Donald Trump: (32:12)
And with Bagram, I hate to say it, but we’re going to keep. We’re going to stay there. It’s right next to China. Nice to have a base like that. It’s got the longest runway there is. The concrete pad is so thick. I couldn’t [inaudible 00:32:26] in construction. I figured maybe six inches. How about six-feet? Six-feet thick. And we left it. They spent supposedly $10 billion, building. And we left it in one night, and we left all the equipment. And don’t believe them when they say they disabled the equipment. They didn’t. You see a couple of helicopters. They didn’t disable. They got killed for leaving the equipment. And so they disabled a couple of little old helicopters. That equipment is brand new, right out of a box, including the night goggles, which are better than the goggles we have. They’re later models. And including all of the rifles, machine guns and guns, they’re the latest model, the latest and the greatest.
Donald Trump: (33:03)
So our enemy of many years has all of that. And it’s a shame. It’s a shame to see what’s happened to our country. It’s a shame, but the general was great. So he called me up. I said, “General, give it to me one more time.” “Four weeks, sir.” I said, “General, go ahead.” “Thank you, sir, very much.” Now he doesn’t give a shit about television. He’s a general. Generals aren’t supposed to care about them. Remember this, just to go back for a second. So when Milley told me that, I said, “What are you a nut job? Are you stupid?” That’s when I realized … That was one of the many times I realized he was stupid. Such a phony story they concocted, but one of the many times. But you know what I realized? He went in to Biden and said the same thing. “Sir, it’s cheaper to leave the equipment than it is to take it.” You’ll have a $5 million army tank. You’ll have a $30 million helicopter, brand new. Think of this. Even if you just flew it into Pakistan, it’s a very short flight. And then you took your time and taken it. We should have taken everything. Most importantly, we should have never lost 13 warriors. And nobody talks about this, and we should talk about it every time, every time.
Donald Trump: (34:22)
We also have numerous young people who have lost a leg, lost an arm, in one case, lost two legs and an arm. And nobody talks. We talk about the 13, and we love those 13. And they’re looking down on us right now. And they’re proud of us, because we what we’re doing. But we had some terribly wounded people. And overall, they lost approximately 250 people. That’s a terrible thing. Should’ve never happened. Should have never happened in that location. Should have happened in Bagram, where you have a big, big wall actually, a wall. You’re not allowed to say wall. They don’t like walls. The Democrats don’t want to build a wall. It was almost completed. I had to start it two-and-a-half years later for one reason, I had to fight off all the lawsuits where they were suing me. And it was just about finished. They would’ve finished the wall.
Donald Trump: (35:14)
But what happened with the general, Raisin Cain, is called me up, said, “Sir, it’s done.” I said, “Done?” “It’s done, sir. And we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in record time. Sir, we hit them so hard. They didn’t know what the hell was happening, sir.” We defeated … We do. We have great generals. We have great soldiers and sailors and everything. I’m so proud of it and so proud of Space Force. Remember, they didn’t like Space Force.
Donald Trump: (35:49)
Space Force going to be one of our most important. We totally rebuilt the military, but we did this. And that was much tougher than withdrawing from Afghanistan, which we wanted to do, we wanted to do. And by the way, speaking of Pakistan, Pakistan would’ve helped us, but we didn’t ask them for the help. We give billions and billions of dollars a year to Pakistan, and they don’t do anything for us. They don’t do anything. They would’ve helped if we did it the right way, so that’s what happened. But we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Think of that. And we knocked out Soleimani, and we knocked al-Baghdadi.
Donald Trump: (36:37)
They didn’t know what the hell happened. And I’ll tell you what, our country was respected again. This would’ve never happened, taking the military out first. And I told this, I said, “Look, Abdul, Abdul, the American soldiers have left.” And he said … I’m doing this like [Schiff 00:37:02] did to me, with a phone call that he made up. Right? But mine is probably totally true. And Abdul, the leader of the Taliban, good fighters, by the way, he said, “You’re crazy. They didn’t leave. Are you crazy? Get him out of here. He’s crazy.” “Sir, they left.” “No, they didn’t.” “They left, sir.” And then they sent a patrol in, call back. They said, “Sir, the Americans have left.” He said, “I don’t believe it.” And then they just walked into Kabul, and they walked into the remaining portions of Afghanistan. They didn’t do that with me.
Donald Trump: (37:38)
They didn’t do that with me. They respected us. Remember this. Again, we had conditions. They weren’t meeting them, we’d hit them hard. They would’ve met every one of those conditions. But remember the first condition was you can’t kill Americans, and you can’t shoot, kill American soldiers. Not one soldier was killed in 18 months. Not one. Think of that. And remember when Biden was making the speech about three weeks ago, and it was a disaster for him, and he was in the middle of a disaster, but he’s protected by the press. They don’t even talk about Afghanistan anymore. They don’t even talk about it. But you remember when he was making this speech, he said, “Well, I will say that in 18 months, we’ve lost no soldiers.” And his people are screaming at him, “Don’t. Stop there. Why did you bring that up? That’s a good thing for Trump.”
Donald Trump: (38:28)
I kept waiting for the, but. There was no, but. We lost no soldiers for 18 months, because Abdul knew that we were going to hit them harder than any country has ever been hit before. Okay. It’s very simple. And he understood that. He understood that. No, it’s a very sad thing that happened. I think to me, Afghanistan is the most embarrassing event in the history of our country. I do think that, and I think that meaning the withdrawal. We went in there, we didn’t fight like we should have. We became a police force instead of the military, as we know it. And just, they didn’t fight. But you know what? They should have. They did what they did, but to leave in disgrace, instead of leaving the way they should have left.
Donald Trump: (39:14)
When I left office, we handed Biden the most secure border in United States history. And that includes from drugs, not just people. We ended catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We struck historic agreements with Mexico and Central American nations to stop illegal immigration. And we built almost 500 miles of powerful border wall, which really helped us. And I want to thank the president of Mexico, great guy. I said, “You have to put your soldiers until we build the wall. You got to put your soldiers. How many do you need? 28,000.” It’s a long wall. That’s a long border. And he did it. He gave us 28,000 soldiers. And that’s why we did things that nobody else could do.
Donald Trump: (40:04)
Now, in all fairness, he did it for a reason. I said, “If you don’t do it, we’re going to put a 25% tariff on all the cars that you make and sell it back into the … ” And they said, “Yes, we’d love to do it. It would be our honor.” Whatever it is, it worked.
Donald Trump: (40:20)
And we have a great relationship with him and with Mexico, and it worked out great. And then these people came, and they tore down everything. Remain in Mexico, gone. All of it’s gone. And people are destroying our country. We tracked down the gang members, the drug smugglers and the dangerous criminal aliens. And we threw them in jail, or we threw them the hell out of our country. Ideally, we wanted to get them out. But some were so dangerous, we put them in jail. Yet Biden has systematically reversed every border security policy that we had in place. Oh, they were so good.
Donald Trump: (40:52)
I say, and I mean it, if Biden, would’ve just gone to the beach, just take it easy, enjoy the surf, you’d have a great border today, because it was getting better and better and better. And you hear all the border patrol people, even people that worked for him, they’re saying we should have left it. They didn’t have to do anything. It was so good. Best we’ve ever had. And people could come in, but they have to come in legally.
Donald Trump: (41:16)
Just days ago, even amid the worst border crisis in history, the Biden administration issued an order, effectively abolishing ICE. These are great patriots. These are tough people. They would go into these gangs of MS-13, the toughest gangs in the world, they say, and they’d go in there and the fist would start … I’d say these people. And I can tell you, I have some tough people in front of me. Some of them are even tough farmers. I don’t even think you people want to do what they do. And they loved it. They wouldn’t want any other job. And they’re great patriots. They love our country, but they were tough, to get rid of MS-13 and some of the worst people that you’ve ever seen.
Donald Trump: (41:57)
I mean, typically when you have tattoos on your face, it’s not a positive event. It’s not positive. When you have a tattoo on your face saying, “We hate America.” And we say, “We’d love to have you.” It’s great. It’s not going to work out well. But when you look at what they’ve done, ICE has been so incredible. And they’ve basically taken away their power and their prestige, but they will be around because nobody can do the job that they did. And that goes for the border patrol and our police department and law enforcement.
Donald Trump: (42:27)
Our police departments are incredible and law enforcement, incredible. I met a lot of them backstage. You have them here, incredible police. And with the Republicans, there’ll be no defunding of the police. I can tell you that. There’ll be no defunding. That’s not working out too well. You see in Minnesota, Minneapolis there, they’re not doing too well. They defunded the police and they cut it. And it’s a disaster. Crime is through the roof, but it is in other places. New York is through the roof. You have district attorneys. They’re looking at Republicans. They’re not looking at people that shoot people every day. It’s a crazy …
Donald Trump: (43:08)
What’s happening is so bad for this country, so dangerous for this country. People want other people to stop shooting and knifing people to death in broad daylight. Did you see the case in Chicago? Gets out of the car, starts shooting somebody, and they just said, “We’re not going to press charges.” And he’s right on tape and right on camera. No, it’s a terrible thing that’s happening. It’s sick. Actually, it’s sick. And it’s only going to lead to the destruction of our country. And other bad things can happen, because I don’t think a lot of people are going to take it for much longer. I’ll be honest. I don’t think they’re going to take it.
Donald Trump: (43:44)
Other countries are emptying their prisons and sending their murderers and drug smugglers and child abusers into the United States. We are becoming a dumping ground. We are a dumping ground for very, very serious criminals. And Joe, you know that. You know, I used to say, it’s in Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador, but it’s not. It’s in many, many countries, many, many, including Middle Eastern countries. They’re taking them out of prison. These are seriously tough people, evil people in many cases. And they’re dumping them in the … We’re becoming a dumping ground. Never before has a president shown such contempt for oath of office. He’s supposed to be protecting our country, not destroying our country.
Donald Trump: (44:33)
Joe Biden has launched a foreign invasion of his own country. Come on in. He said, “Come in.” This is a sick thing that’s happening to our country. Not even explainable. I used to say it was incompetence, but it is that. But you know what it really is? I don’t know. It’s almost like evil. They want this to happen, because they’re paying $6 million a day to contractors to not finish the wall, which could be finished very rapidly. They’re paying millions of dollars a day to contractors. And do I know tractors. They’re making a fortune. They’re making more money now than they would ever make if they built it. But they’re paying millions and millions of dollars a day, a week, a month to these contractors not to build the wall. And you wonder, is that incompetence, or is that just a bad ideology? You know? It’s probably a lot of both.
Donald Trump: (45:32)
Biden had the gall to attack our brave border agents in the midst of this nightmarish disaster. And remember the horses, these guys with the horses, to keep illegal immigrants out of our country, or to keep them at bay. And now they’re fighting for their lives, those people. And it wasn’t a whip by the way. They didn’t have whips. They didn’t have whips. What a sad thing is going on.
Donald Trump: (45:59)
In the Republican party, we will always stand with law enforcement and our great heroes of law enforcement. And we will keep America safe. All of these calamities are the direct, predictable and disastrous consequence of a totally corrupt election. It’s all because of the corrupt election. They rigged the election. And now based on the rigged election, they’re destroying our country. That’s not a mandate. That’s a destruction of our country. Remember this, it’s not about me being robbed of an election. This is about the American people, having their country taken away from them. That’s what it’s really about.
Donald Trump: (46:47)
Just recently, we got the results of the Arizona forensic audit, but the papers refused to report it the way it was, which showed massive irregularities, to put it nicely. That’s a nice word. A few in the findings, 23,344 mail-in ballots came from people who no longer lived at that address. Oh, that’s wonderful. The entire margin in the state, remember, or as they say, lost. We didn’t lose. But the number they concocted was 10,457. That’s what I lost by 10,000 votes. A little more than 10,000. There was no chain of custody, which you have to have provided for. Listen to this, no chain of custody for 1.9 million mail-in ballots. Now think of that. We need 10,000. There’s no chain of custody for 1.9 million. There were 2,500 duplicated ballots with no serial numbers. Oh, they have to have a serial number. What happened to the serial number?
Donald Trump: (47:55)
There was also missing serial numbers on thousands and thousands of adjudicated ballots. At least 1,900 blank mail-in ballot envelopes were discovered. Well, it’s not supposed to be blank. There were numerous bad signatures or mail-in ballot envelopes that should not have been counted. These are all things that they have. 2,081 votes were cast by people who had moved out of the state. Oh, that’s wonderful. But we’re talking about Arizona. You’re supposed to live in Arizona. 10, 324 voters might have voted in multiple counties. Oh, well, that’s okay. I vote here. Let’s vote in another county, maybe two or three or four. 284,412 ballot images were quote, corrupt, they quoted, corrupt or missing. Oh, but I only lost by a little more than 10,000 votes. In addition, the auditors discovered that millions of the election related files, the files were deleted during and after the election, in violation of federal law, including a purge of the election management system software the day before the audit began. Oh, I see.
Donald Trump: (49:17)
And the Justice Department was scared or impotent. They didn’t want to do anything about it. It’s been going on for years, but never like this. Again, they used COVID in order to cheat, with all of these ballots and all of this early voting and late voting. Likewise, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case by Texas and almost 20 other states. And now their approval rating is the lowest it’s been in memory. They have the lowest approval rating in memory. And I believe it’s for the reason that they refused or didn’t have the courage. They rule against me all the time, all the time, very personal rulings. They didn’t have the courage to do something about the election. And I believe that’s the real reason their ratings or their approval numbers are so low.
Donald Trump: (50:09)
These horrific findings are now in the hands of the Arizona attorney general. And let’s hope that he does the right thing for our country. I don’t know that he will, I don’t know that he will, but let’s hope he does. Our country needs it, Arizona needs it. And with all of those numbers being so horrible-
Audience: (50:29)
Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won.
Donald Trump: (50:36)
We did.
Audience: (50:36)
Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won.
Donald Trump: (50:36)
We did.
Audience: (50:36)
Trump won, Trump won, Trump won, Trump won.
Donald Trump: (50:48)
Thank you. Very, very sad for our country. The whole world laughs at us on this too, this, the border, Afghanistan. But with all of those numbers being so horrible, Arizona was in my opinion, the least corrupt of the other swing states. I think it was the least corrupt. It was so corrupt. They used the word “determinative”. That means are there enough votes? Like for instance, if you had 300 dead people voting, but you needed 10,000 votes, I wouldn’t even talk about that. But we have a determinative result many, many times over, so many times over, otherwise I wouldn’t bring it up. It was recently reported that 43,000 absentee ballot votes were counted in DeKalb County, Georgia, that violated the chain of custody rules, 43,000. Georgia was decided by only 11,779 votes. In other words, I needed 11,779 votes, and they have 40,000 here and 20,000 here. There were many other infractions in Georgia, but the Secretary of State, Raffensperger, and the governor of …
Donald Trump: (52:03)
Secretary of State, Raffensperger, and the Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, who I got elected by giving him an endorsement. Thank you very much for that recommendation to endorse this guy, absolutely refused to do anything about it. He hurt our Party and he hurt our country very badly. Kemp was in last place when I endorsed him, and he ended up winning because of my endorsement in a landslide. He’s afraid of Stacey Abrams. I don’t know what the hell that she’s got, but he and the Republicans, but he is afraid of Stacey Abrams and refuses to take on the corrupt Democrats in the State of Georgia, just refuses. I know, it’s fraught with danger. It’s fraught with danger, but you have to do it. It’s for the country.
Donald Trump: (52:53)
But think of this. I win Alabama. I love Alabama. I win Alabama by a record vote, a record. I win South Carolina by a record vote, but right next to them is Georgia and I lose by that much, it doesn’t work that way. A new investigation by True the Vote alleges a gigantic illegal ballot harvesting operation, involving large numbers of people throughout the State of Georgia and many other places.
Donald Trump: (53:24)
Why aren’t they investigating the stuff? They are not investigating it. Jody Hice will end up taking over that job and he’ll investigate. Congressman Jody Hice gave up his absolutely guaranteed seat because he saw what was happening, how corrupt it is in Georgia. Also in Georgia, everybody’s heard the water main break story, right? Where people were rushed out of the Vote Tabulation Room because of a water main break.
Donald Trump: (53:51)
“There’s a water main break, everybody leave.” They all ran out, but there was no water main break. Only to see a crew of Democrat operatives, or whoever, come back and start pouring votes into machines from boxes that mysteriously appeared from under a table, from under a table.
Donald Trump: (54:14)
And the Governor found nothing wrong with that, and the Justice Department found nothing wrong with that. And it’s on tape, and it’s like baseball now and football. They do action replays in magnified [inaudible 00:54:27]. They have a fashionable, magnified tape and you can see just about everything. It’s a sad thing. I think they have cases where they had the same one, three times, four times, five times, but that was all a fake story. There was no water main break.
Donald Trump: (54:46)
And then they actually said, “No, the water main break took place 250 miles away,” somebody said. I don’t know if that’s correct or not, but they were looking all over the place for a water main, that didn’t work out too well. So Georgia is very, very sad, and the law they pass isn’t tough enough, by the way. They weakened it because Stacy Abrams wanted it weakened. She wanted it weakened and they do whatever she says. Pretty amazing. I don’t know. Hey, maybe she’ll be running for President, I’d like that. Let’s run against Stacey Abrams, I’d like that.
Donald Trump: (55:18)
In Pennsylvania, they were reportedly hundreds of thousands of more votes than there were voters, oh, I see. Philadelphia, more votes than voters. That’s a tough one to explain. Why didn’t they do something about that? Hopefully the people of Pennsylvania are angry that this can be allowed to happen, and will not allow the Republican majority to be re-elected if they don’t get to the bottom of it fast, but there’s no getting to the bottom. We won the State.
Donald Trump: (55:51)
I was up by massive numbers on election day. Even the news was saying, “Wow, what a big lead in Pennsylvania.” I love Pennsylvania, I went to school in Pennsylvania College, but what a great State and what great people, and I was up by so much, all of a sudden the booths closed, the Tabulation Centers are closed, three o’clock in the morning. And shortly thereafter, we’re tied and then we’re losing by just a little bit. We’re just losing by just a little bit. No, it’s a disgrace. And the US Attorney said that he was told by the Attorney General not to do anything. The US Attorney was a pretty tough guy. He was told not to do anything by the Attorney General because the Attorney General, I think didn’t want to have problems. He was very worried about certain things with regard to himself, and I think it was probably the easy way out, but so bad for our country. The US Attorney of Philadelphia, in the Philadelphia area said, “I was told…” In writing, said, “I was told not to do anything, not to pursue it.”
Donald Trump: (57:01)
And Philadelphia was so corrupt. Pittsburgh was very corrupt, they say, but think of it, more votes than you had voters. That’s a pretty easy one. We don’t have to go into a lot of detail. That’s a pretty easy one. In Pennsylvania, thousands of voters reported receiving at least two ballots in the mail, and many others reported receiving mail-in ballots without requesting them. They just happened to flow in, they flowed in.
Donald Trump: (57:27)
On election day, thousands of people were complaining that they weren’t allowed to vote because they were told that their ballot had already been cast. How many people… Here in Iowa, you had a good clean… You have a great Governor. You had a clean… Who happens to be here. Where is she? Where’s your Governor? Stand up. Stand up, Kim. Great Governor. I’ll be introducing you. I’ll be introducing [inaudible 00:57:50]. But no, she did a great job.
Donald Trump: (57:54)
Kim, if you had more votes than you had voters, would that bother you? When they say, “Sir, you have more votes than voters,” and they don’t want to do anything about it. They complained vehemently, some laughed in disgust. Think of it. People walk in and they’re proud. And the Republicans tend to vote on election day, and the Democrats tend to use ballots, right? Maybe they’re better off using ballots, the way it happened, because it was a shocker.
Donald Trump: (58:20)
But people would walk in and they were proud people. They don’t want anybody playing with the ballots. They don’t want anything to go wrong. “So I’m going to vote on election day.” They get up and they get out, and they vote, and they go and they say, “I’d like to vote.” “I’m sorry ma’am, you’ve already voted.” “I haven’t voted. I just came here.” “No, no, ma’am, I’m sorry, you voted.” This happened by the thousands and thousands.
Donald Trump: (58:50)
And you know what? Some would walk out laughing in disgust. Some walked out crying. So many complaints. It’s such a disgrace. There’s never been anything like this ever happened in our country before, and I think everybody has a good idea who got those votes. You ever see some of those so-called lockboxes? I call them unlocked boxes.
Donald Trump: (59:19)
97% of the vote goes to sleepy Joe Biden, 97. I said, “I did really well in that State. I don’t think I only got 3%. You’ve got to look at those boxes. You have to look at the tabulation, at the numbers, the unlocked boxes.” In Michigan, the legislature found that over 300,000 people were listed on the voter rolls, even though they hadn’t voted in over 20 years. Oh, and again, in Detroit, which is known as the single most corrupt election venue in the country for many years, but nobody went to look at that, there were many more votes than there were voters.
Donald Trump: (01:00:04)
And if you saw the percentage of errors on the vote, it was almost infinite decimal, where even four years ago, when you didn’t have all the mail-in ballot and all of the… It wasn’t like it was this time. They had 4%. This year we had none, with mail-in ballots, they had almost nothing. And then I have to listen to people and they say, “There was no fraud, there was no fraud.”
Donald Trump: (01:00:31)
Over 40 years, bellwether Counties have correctly predicted every election. Bellwether Counties, it’s a big deal. I won almost every bellwether County, more than any other President. I won 18 out of 19. No President has ever done that, 18 out of 19. If you got just a small number, you win. I won 18 out of 19, the most any President’s ever won.
Donald Trump: (01:01:02)
Think of it, we won 27 out of 27 toss-up House races. We won all 27. So they like to say, “Well, the people in the House were more popular than Trump.” No, I made robocalls for them. I made calls for them. I helped them, and some of them said to me, a lot of them said, “It’s impossible. We got X percentage of vote. I got more than you, but you were much more popular in my District than I was.”
Donald Trump: (01:01:29)
It’s amazing. That’s what happened to our country. I had numerous calls from people saying, “Sir, it’s not possible that I beat you. Every poll, every… There was no way that I beat you. This election was rigged.” They said that. “This election was rigged.” And no Presidential candidate has ever lost an election while winning Florida, Ohio, and a place called Iowa. First time it’s ever happened. So think of it, think of it. Think of it, in the history of our country, if you win Iowa, Florida, and Ohio, no President has ever… If you win that, you don’t lose, never happened. All these elections, so many years, never happened. Thank you very much, Iowa. We love you. Thank you. Joe Biden lost with the African American population to former President, Barack Hussein Obama in every single State, other than the five swing States. In other words, the only States that were going to determine the election, although I think a lot of other States were corrupt also, but the only swing States, the swing States that determined, that’s where Biden won with the African American population.
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
I don’t think so. No, I don’t think so. I don’t believe that. In other words, the election was a fraud and if we want to save our country and make America great again, we have only one choice. We must elect strong and unyielding America first Republicans at every level, and we must pass a complete overhaul of our entire election system to ensure it’s free, fair, honest, and able to be fully and quickly audited. I tell a lot of these Republicans in Congress and all, they don’t want to get involved. And I say… Go ahead, let’s go. Go! [crosstalk 01:03:47]
Donald Trump: (01:03:48)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your support. You’ve been incredible. Iowa has been incredible, but I tell a lot of these Republicans, some rhinos, but people that do like us, people that love the country, “Sir, think to the future. You shouldn’t go back to the past. You have to think.” I say, “I’ve been doing this stuff a long time now, not as long as [inaudible 01:04:18], but for a long time. And I’m telling you, the single biggest issue, as bad as the border is, it’s horrible, horrible what they’re doing. They’re destroying our country. As bad as that is, the single biggest issue, the issue that gets the most pull, the most respect, the biggest cheers is talking about the election fraud of 2020 Presidential election. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.”
Donald Trump: (01:04:45)
And these guys will say… And they mean it. You have some bad guys and then you have the Democrats. They don’t want to be caught. A lot of the steal, a lot of what they do is they don’t want to talk about it because they know we’re so close. They don’t want to talk. And when they say cancel and cancel culture, you know why it’s canceled? It’s not canceled for any other reason. It’s canceled because they don’t want anyone talking about the election.
Donald Trump: (01:05:09)
They don’t write about it. I’ll bet you, their damn cameras went off. They don’t talk about it. They don’t write about it because they know they got caught. They know they got caught. All you have to do is listen to the numbers. And remember what I said, Arizona was more honest than the other States, in my opinion, much more honest than some of them. But the single biggest topic that they want, people that love our country, because they said, “If you don’t solve this, people aren’t going to vote in ’22 and ’24. They don’t want to go through this again.”
Donald Trump: (01:05:47)
When we have numbers, when I go to Arizona or Pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania, Butler, Pennsylvania, I had 58,000 people show up in a small town in the middle of Pennsylvania, just before the vote. And I said, “It’s not possible to lose this. That’s like the ultimate poll.” He would go there and he’d have eight circles and he couldn’t fill them, so the press would stand there. They couldn’t fill eight circles. We had 58,000 people.
Donald Trump: (01:06:13)
I go to Arizona. I went twice. We had 38,000, 42,000, I think maybe even a third time, well over 40,000 and I laughed. I said, “Not possible to lose.” And then all of a sudden, you lose just by a whisper. Now, fraudulent numbers shouldn’t take months to accumulate with Democrats and rhino Republicans in the way of every single step we take, they’re in the way. We got them by surprise.
Donald Trump: (01:06:44)
We all got them by surprise in 2016 and they said, “We’ll never let this happen again.” They worked hard for four years and yet we did far better in 2020 than we did in 2016. It was a rigged election. It’s very interesting, a reporter from one of the people, sending back that big one, on the liberal side said, “What was the difference between 2020 and 2016?” I said, “Well, the primary difference was I did much better in 2020 than I did in 2016. The rallies were bigger. The enthusiasm was even greater, if that’s possible. And we got far more votes, almost 75,000,000 votes, more than any sitting President has ever gotten.” Last time we got 63,000,000. We got 12,000,000 more votes. No President in history has ever gotten that many more votes from the time before, not even close. So we got 63,000,000 in 2016. I was told by the best pollster, supposedly the best pollster. I won’t use his name because you have other good pollsters, but you have mostly, really bad pollsters, evil pollsters, crooked pollsters. But they came to me and they said, “Sir, you got 63,000,000 votes. If you get 64,000,000 votes, you can’t lose. If you get 65,000,000 it’s over, sir.” I got almost 75,000,000, probably I got 85,000,000 but who the hell knows?
Donald Trump: (01:08:14)
And we lost, they say, and our country’s paying a very big price as everybody knows. And by the way, you know who was one of our best supporters in Congress? A guy named Chuck Grassley, one of our best supporters on election fraud. He was one of our best supporters, and I’m going to introduce him in a second because I have something very important to say about him, but he was one… He’d write these letters, and when Chuck speaks, “Were you lying? Did you leak?” And he’s actually trying to be nice, but the voice is so tough. He scares the hell… Remember he scared the hell out of Komie? “Did you leak?” “Yes, I’m sorry,” like Perry Mason.
Donald Trump: (01:08:54)
As everybody here knows, my new slogan was going to be Make America… Remember this, remember? It was supposed to be something a little different than Make America Great. It was supposed to be Keep America Great, but America’s not great right now. So we’re using the same slogan, Make America Great Again. And we may even add to it, but we’ll keep it, Make America Great Again, Again, because we already did it, right? We’re going to make America great again, again.
Donald Trump: (01:09:29)
No, I had a whole big deal and it was all good, and it was just going to be Keep America Great because we made it great. Our military was rebuilt, our economy was great. Our job numbers were the best. We had the best country we’ve ever had, and in nine months, little more, they’ve destroyed our country. So I can’t say Keep America Great. So I’m back to Make America Great Again-/, Again. Make America Great Again, Again. I don’t know, what do you like better? Really, if you think about it, it’s more accurate. Make America Great Again, Again, because we made it great. Now we have to make it great again. So it’s one of those things, but Make America Great Again, our nation’s comeback begins in November 2022, when we’re going to reclaim the House, and we’re going to reclaim the United States Senate.
Donald Trump: (01:10:34)
And we have with us tonight, a great American patriot, a man who truly loves Iowa, loves Iowa. He’s young, very young guy. He’s strong and he’s very handsome. He fights like no other. When I’ve needed him for help, he was always there, especially with anything having to do with farmers, and that includes ethanol. Nobody’s ever done more. I know more about ethanol than anybody in the audience, I think.
Donald Trump: (01:11:10)
He was with us all the way. Every time I needed something, he’s very persnickety sometimes, right? He’s tough. But when I needed him, he was always there. And I just want to ask Senator Chuck Grassley just to come up for a second. Chuck Grassley, strong on military, strong on Vets, strong on our under siege Second Amendment. He helped pass the USMCA, helped confirm almost 300 Federal Judges and three great Supreme court Justices.
Donald Trump: (01:11:46)
Come here. You are the greatest. Look at this, he’s young. I’m thrilled to announce tonight that Senator Chuck Grassley has my complete and total endorsement for re-election. Chuck? [crosstalk 01:12:02].
Chuck Grassley: (01:12:14)
I was born at night, but not last night. So if I didn’t accept the endorsement of a person that’s got 91% of the Republican voters in Iowa, I wouldn’t be too smart. I’m smart enough to accept that endorsement. [crosstalk 01:12:33]
Donald Trump: (01:12:39)
He’s a great guy. He is a great gentlemen. I think he’s never missed a vote, can you believe it? After so many decades, you’re lucky to have him. We’re also delighted to be joined by your Governor, Kim Reynolds. I’ve gotten to know her so well. She’s so tough. She’s so tough. Kim, great job.
Donald Trump: (01:13:08)
I said, “Kim, do you want me to endorse you tonight or later?” She said, “Sir, this is Chuck Grassley’s night.” How nice is that? “So if you would, give it to me sometime in the very near future, if you don’t mind.” I thought that was very nice Kim, most people wouldn’t say that. They’d say, “Give it to me now,” but she’s been an incredible Governor, done a great job. Loves our farmers, our people, loves everybody. Respected, and she’s had some tough races and she always comes out on top. She’s smarter and she’s tougher. So I’ll be talking to you soon about it, endorsement Kim. I refuse to do it now, Kim, okay?
Donald Trump: (01:13:52)
Members of Congress, they’ve been incredible, highly respected. Ashley Hinson, Ashley, Ashley. Great job. Great job, Ashley. And Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Mariannette, thank you. Proud of them. By the way, we have a man. We talk about strong people and weak people. We talk about stupid people and smart people, but we have a man from Arizona with us tonight. He is tough as hell. He’s incredible, and he is running for a certain position that’s going to be, I think a very easy victory. Arizona State Representative, Mark Finchem is with us tonight, and what a job he’s done. Mark, great job Mark. You’re going to win big, Mark. Because he’s tough, they say he’s controversial. It’s not controversial. He’s actually not controversial.
Donald Trump: (01:14:50)
A man that I’ve gotten to know over a five-year period, a man who runs an organization as well as anybody, can run any organization, Iowa GOP Chair, Jeff Kaufmann. Jeff, great job Jeff. What a job. You got a record crowd tonight, Jeff. And you’re the one that started this whole thing, I will tell you. “Sir, do you mind coming out to Iowa?” “Sure Jeff, anytime.” I didn’t know it would be such a big deal with the Iowa football game, but that was pretty big. That was pretty big.
Donald Trump: (01:15:23)
And also, former Acting Attorney General, a friend of mine, a great, great guy. And there’s somebody up in heaven looking down on you right now because he loves his pop, Matt Whitaker. Matt, he loves his pop. Do you understand that? We love Matt. He was a football player. He was a football player, look at the size of that guy, huh? He was a great football player.
Donald Trump: (01:15:52)
Under our administration, we accomplished more in four years than almost any President ever dreamt of accomplishing. What we did with the military. We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts in the history of our country. We stood up to China, never has anybody done this to China. We took in billions and billions of dollars when nobody else was able to take in 25 cents. Nobody took in money from China. And when China economically attacked our great farmers, we remember that Kim very well, don’t we? I went back and I started doing tariffs on China, and I took out $28 billion over a two year period. I gave it to our great farmers all over the country, including Iowa.
Donald Trump: (01:16:43)
And Chuck Grassley wanted me to do it, and Kim wanted me to do it. We gave $16 billion and $12 billion. They made so much money. Those farmers are so rich. You remember what I said? I said to the farmers, I said, “You’re going to suffer for a little while because we negotiated an incredible trade deal with China.” I don’t know if they’re going to honor the deal under Biden, but they sure as hell honored it under me, and the farmers made a lot of money.
Donald Trump: (01:17:11)
But do you remember what I said? “Go out and buy yourself more land and bigger tractors.” Do you remember? It turned out to be true. They’ve never been so successful as they are now because of what we did. Don’t give credit to the guy that’s sitting there right now. He doesn’t like farmers. I then signed a trade deal with China that made so much sense because they were taking such advantage of our country, but the farmers were the biggest beneficiary, and manufacturers too.
Donald Trump: (01:17:41)
I kept my promises. I kept my promises to Iowa. I kept my promises to everybody, and I kept my promises to protect Iowa ethanol, and that turned out to be a very important promise. Thank you, Kim, for getting us so involved in that. I approved E15 for use all year round, and I allowed higher…
Donald Trump: (01:18:03)
… E15 for use all year round, and I allowed higher ethanol gasoline to be distributed from existing pumps. Remember they wanted it brand new, brand new. I said, “What’s the difference?” No difference. You just have to spend a fortune in doing it. So I used existing pumps. And with the help of Iowa farmers, we became energy independent for the first time ever, ever. They say, “75 years.” Ever. And America was respected again and respected like we have never been respected before.
Donald Trump: (01:18:34)
Under Joe Biden, America’s no longer respected. And the world watched the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal, and they took … You just see what they look. Every night, they were watching. Every day, they were watching. Our borders were exploding and the fake news refused to report it, but everybody saw it. And they see it now. And by the way, it’s worse now than it was last month and worse now than it was two months and three months and four months ago. It’s at a level that is unsustainable by any country.
Donald Trump: (01:19:07)
And again, they’re emptying their prisons, and people are coming into our country. We should never allow this to happen. They’re destroying the United States of America, and our credibility has been literally thrown the window. And now the Democrats want to send $10 billion to Afghanistan. Despite the fact that when Biden, hopelessly surrendered to them just a month ago and moved our military out first, we left them with the $85 billion of the finest military equipment in the world. And now he wants to give them $10 billion of your taxpayer money on top of everything else. And we shouldn’t do that, unless … here’s an idea. We have breaking news, unless they’re willing to give back 100% of the military equipment that our television generals left behind. Isn’t that a good idea?
Donald Trump: (01:20:11)
I mean, you hate to give them 10, but it’s … I wouldn’t give many money unless they gave us back the equipment. I wouldn’t do anything. And remember this, we also have American hostages over there. They haven’t played that game yet. They will. That’s why they’re doing … They’re paying the 10 billion, because we have so many people over there. And I guarantee the Taliban, very tough, very smart. Afghans, great negotiators. And they say, “What are you going to do, if we give back the people that automatically would’ve just walked out with us very easily?” And they weren’t doing anything. We could have taken six months, a year, two years, five years, or we could have taken two months, could have done it as fast as we want. They were leaving us alone. They didn’t like jets over their heads, with machine guns and bombs. They didn’t like it, as tough as they may be. But you know what’s happened? They look at us now, like we’re stupid people.
Donald Trump: (01:21:06)
So we shouldn’t be giving them $10 billion. And if we do give them 10 billion, we demand every ounce of equipment back. And we want our hostages back immediately. And if we don’t get our hostages back … And you know the amazing thing about politicians? I’ve never heard that idea. That idea’s never been thrown around. They don’t even think of these things. But think, how much sense …
Donald Trump: (01:21:29)
I don’t want to give them 10 billion, but if we’re going to give them … Let Russia give them money, by the way, let Iran give them money. That’s their territory. And they’re right there. We’re doing their work for them. And then we’re supposed to keep them going. Biden’s giving them $10 billion so that he doesn’t look bad. Because they’re tough, and they’ll do numbers on us.
Donald Trump: (01:21:47)
Now, we want our hostages back immediately and we want our equipment back immediately. And then we can start talking about doing what we could do. I wouldn’t mind doing it under those … We want our hostages back. We want our equipment back, and then we can start talking about that.
Audience: (01:22:19)
[crosstalk 01:22:19]-
Donald Trump: (01:22:21)
So leaving Afghanistan was a good thing. I was going to leave. We should have left however, under the symbols of strength and dignity, not weakness and surrender. We could have left under strength and dignity in the same period of time. It didn’t have to take long. We could have been respected right now. I don’t know that we’ll ever recover from this, from allies to everything else. And you know what? Every ally’s take an advantage of us. So I’m less concerned about. They all take advantage. Or NATO, they take advantage, Germany, France, all of them. We’re like the stupid people. We’re like a country run by stupid people. Every single nation and every deal that I’ve looked at, and I looked at countries that many people have never even heard of, we made bad deals. Every single country. It’s almost, you wonder, how do you sustain? How does it keep going?
Donald Trump: (01:23:17)
Our soldiers are heartbroken at what happened in Afghanistan. They wanted to win. They wanted to be respected. They wanted to show strength, and our television generals wouldn’t allow them to do that. Just imagine how hard China is laughing, when they see our woke politicians and woke generals, injecting poisonous ideologies into our schools and into our military. You’ve seen the military of China. You’ve seen what they have, a million soldiers standing out on the square. You think they’re told about the things that we are telling our soldiers and our school children? They laugh in our face. They think we’re a failing nation. And I ended all of that. But one of the first things they did when Mitch McConnell said, “We have to get back to business.” Mitch McConnell should have challenged that election, because even back then we had of material to challenge that election. He should have challenged the election. Schumer would’ve challenged the election, but Mitch McConnell didn’t have the courage to challenge the election. He’s only a leader because he raises a lot of money, and he gives it to senators. That’s the only thing he’s got. That’s his only form of leadership. He should have challenged the election. He said, “Now we have to get back to work. We have to get back.” And the first thing that happened is Biden signed 17 executive orders that were devastating to our country. And now the Democrats want $6 billion in new federal funding to teach critical race theory, which I ended in our schools at the same time that Biden is unleashing the FBI on parents who stand up and object at school board meetings. The parents are the enemy. Biden is using federal law enforcement to threaten and silence citizen who oppose radical left indoctrination. To Joe Biden, the hated Taliban, our enemy for many years, killed many soldiers, we killed many of them, is an enforced upon us partner because of their weakness and their stupidity while patriotic American moms and dads are the enemy.
Donald Trump: (01:25:43)
That’s what’s happened to our country. Along with the constant use of city, state, and federal prosecutors, this chilling left-wing tyranny is the kind of thing you see in Russia and China and Third World dictatorships. It’s un-American. It’s got to stop. We’re not going to have a country left. We’re not going to have a country left. The only thing the radical Democrats are good at is hoaxes, witch hunts and abuses of power. You saw where the Russia, Russia, Russia was a totally made up and paid for by the Democrats and crooked Hillary scheme.
Donald Trump: (01:26:23)
For five straight years, it has been a con job, one after another. One con job after another, a nonstop parade of fake whistle-blowers, phony investigations, twisted conspiracy theories, and very, very perverted lies. First, it was Russia, Russia, Russia. I said, “I don’t know anything about Russia.” People would come up to be, “Sir, do you know anything about Russia?” People that worked for me early on. I said, “No, I don’t. Didn’t even think about it.” Month later, somebody comes up, “Sir, so great to meet you. Sir, do you know anything about Russia?” “No, I don’t. I don’t.” I wonder why he asks. Another one would come couple of months later, “Sir, do you know anything about Russia?” Now, I’m starting to say, “What the hell’s going on with Russia?” And then it started.
Donald Trump: (01:27:21)
And they said they were going to impeach me before I even got sworn in. They said, “We’re going to impeach Trump.” It was in The Washington Post. Three days before I got sworn in, they said, “We’re going to impeach Trump.” And I mean it, I had to run a country .and I had to survive. Those were my two jobs and the surviving was tougher than running the country, but then it was Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
Donald Trump: (01:27:46)
Remember that? A phone call, perfect phone call. In fact, some of the senators said, “I never knew he could be so nice.” The call was so good, and I got impeached. But we had impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two, the witch hunt against Justice Kavanaugh, Supreme Court Justice. It was a witch hunt. And then it became, and that’s what we’re doing now, every story you see, they’ll quote all these numbers and all this stuff. And there’s many more. This was just a small sampling of the things that they found. And every story, these fake people, crooked people write, they say, “There is no evidence of election fraud.” You ever see that? You read the papers. You’re reading about this. Then they say, “While there’s an election, there is no election fraud.” While these claims are totally unsubstantiated, they are. There’s massive evidence, or it’s a big lie.
Donald Trump: (01:28:43)
Remember that? The big lie. That’s what they … While it’s a big lie. And on MSDNC, which is also dying in the ratings, but between the two of them … That’s why I really thought that MSDNC and CNN would sometime prior to the election endorse me. We want Donald Trump, because their ratings have gone down the tubes. But they called it the big lie. But the big lie turned out to be the corrupt election itself. But you ever notice where you always read in there, “While there is no evidence to prove this,” there’s so much evidence, it’s pouring out of our ears. We’ve never had so much evidence.
Donald Trump: (01:29:25)
And let them look at it, let them go over it, or let them prove it’s wrong. But the people of this country, whether it’s Arizona or Georgia, or Wisconsin or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and if you look at all of Michigan and others, the people get it more so than the politicians. With that being said, we have some great, great Republican politicians. And they proved that on Thursday, when they totally decimated the people that were making the Arizona presentation in Congress. Andy Biggs, Jim Jordan, Congressman Clyde. They totally devastated. It’s funny. They were going point after point. All bullshit. These other people, all giving all bullshit.. And within about 10 minutes, it was proven that the whole thing was a fraud, but the press didn’t want to report it.
Donald Trump: (01:30:21)
The left’s new obsession is the un-select committee. They have an un-select committee. I call it the [inaudible 01:30:27]. It’s called a select committee. For those of you that aren’t that aware. We have appointed a select committee. You know who’s on the committee? Swalwell, who likes the Chinese spy. Why aren’t they investigating Swalwell? What a sleazebag. Why aren’t they investigating him for being with … I say, “being with.” What is being with? I’ll give you a definition afterwards. For being with a Chinese spy. Why does he have to be with a Chinese spy? And he’s on the big committees. But we have all these people.
Donald Trump: (01:31:03)
And then of course we have the warmonger-er Liz Cheney. She’s a real beauty. She’s going to lose big in Wyoming. Think she’s down to 9% approval. Terrible. But as I’ve said before, the truth is a force of nature. It’s going to come out. It’s all coming out. Hang in there. Everything the extreme left touches throughout history, it leads to misery and destruction and failure. But with all of you in Iowa and conservative patriots all across the country, we will end their reign of radicalism, and we will take back America. We’re going to take back America.
Audience: (01:31:47)
[crosstalk 01:31:47]. USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA-
Donald Trump: (01:32:12)
Such a great country, such a loving country. With the Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for American families, fair trade for American workers and more American factories. Remember for two years, I’ve been coming up, talking about factories. And five years ago, when I started in Iowa, I talked about your farms, and I talked about factories all over the country. And the job we did was incredible, but it’s being wiped out by people that have no clue as to what … Or they may have a clue. And that’s even more dangerous. They may. But American factories forging more product, stamped with that beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” Made in the USA. We will shut down Joe Biden’s border disaster, and we got to do it quickly. We can’t let this go on. This is poisoning our country. People say, “Three years.” They say, “Two years. Sir, you’ll win in three years.” We’re not going to have a country left in three years.
Donald Trump: (01:33:22)
We’ll again, end catch-and-release. We will stand strong and demanding that we start up, remain in Mexico. They couldn’t come into our country until we had them fully checked out. Most didn’t make it. And most didn’t come up, because they knew they weren’t going to make it. So we didn’t have a problem, where millions of people are pouring up through South America. We will quickly complete the border wall, and we will end illegal immigration once and for all. We will have to start it all over again. Would’ve been so much better if we had an honest election, but we’ll be able to do it again. We will hold China accountable for unleashing the virus and charge them trillions of dollars for the unbelievable suffering they have caused to our country and all around the world.
Donald Trump: (01:34:17)
We will reign in the big tech monopolies, crooked as can be. We will reject left-wing cancel culture, and we will restore the right to free speech in America, which we don’t have anymore. We don’t have it anymore. There is no free speech. We don’t have free speech anymore. It used to be automatic, free speech. We don’t have free speech. We have the opposite of free speech. And this is the beginning of communism, when you hear that. This is the beginning of communism. We will protect innocent life. We will defend our Constitution. We will defend the Second Amendment, and we will proudly uphold the Judeo-Christian values and principles of our nation’s founding.
Donald Trump: (01:35:11)
We will care for our great veterans. I love our veterans. I love our veterans. We had the highest approval rating of any president for taking care of our veterans. 92%, 92%. We will continue to strengthen our military and give our police officers, border patrol, ICE and law enforcement our 100% support. We love you. You know we love you. The whole country loves you.
Donald Trump: (01:35:47)
We will ban critical race theory in our classrooms. We will ban that horrible, crazy, critical race theory in our military. We will ban it from our workplaces. We will ban it from our federal state and local governments. It will be banned, permanently banned, and will never be allowed to come back again. We will restore patriotic education to our schools, and we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history and to always respect our great American flag.
Donald Trump: (01:36:38)
Our movement is the greatest and most powerful in the history of our country. And it’s based on one thought, make America great again. Yet we are up against some of the most sinister forces and entrenched interests that anyone has ever seen in our country. We’ve never encountered anything like this. But no matter how big or powerful they may appear, you must never forget that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you, belongs to you.
Donald Trump: (01:37:22)
This is your home. This is your heritage and our magnificent American liberty is your God-given right. And just in closing, I just want to say the United States of America will not tell you how to live, how to think, what to do. You will not be bossed by incompetent, dishonest, disgusting politicians, by big tech tyrants, by left-wing bullies or anybody else, because we are a great, proud and sovereign people. We know what to do. We are a great, proud and sovereign nation. We are born free. We will live free, and we will win again like we’ve never and ever won before.
Donald Trump: (01:38:21)
The great state of Iowa, and it is indeed a great state, was founded by strong and righteous frontiersmen and magnificent pioneer women who defied the dangers in order to carve out a life and a home for their families. They tamed the wilderness. They braved the elements. They tilled the soil, they worked the fields. And they poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest nation and the history of the world. And we will never let anyone take that away from us. Never. Our ancestors summoned the courage to fight and win our independence and wars against the most powerful nations on earth. We won the First World War. We won the Second World War. Afghanistan, we couldn’t even take our troops out properly. Think of it. They stormed the beaches to crush fascism. They found the strength to topple communism. And that’s what’s happening with our country today. Communism.
Donald Trump: (01:39:34)
Communism is happening with our country today. We’re not going to let it happen. We will not be afraid of woke agitators who despise our country, hate our people and ultimately want us to lose. They want us to lose. There is no mountain we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. There is no challenge we cannot meet. There is no victory we cannot have, as long as we remember that we are proud and mighty Americans. We have great people.
Donald Trump: (01:40:12)
We have great people. And JJ and Janet, thank you, JJ and Janet, friends of mine are here today. We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never ever back down, and we will never, ever surrender. We will never surrender, like they just did in Afghanistan.
Donald Trump: (01:40:39)
My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun. And remember this. Look at the crowd tonight. In theory, there’s not even an election and yet you broke records. We have bigger crowds now, everywhere. Not just in Iowa, everywhere. We have bigger crowds everywhere. There’s more spirit now than there was before the election. Nobody ever thought a thing like that could happen.
Audience: (01:41:09)
We love you.
Donald Trump: (01:41:09)
Thank you.
Audience: (01:41:09)
We love you, we love you.
Donald Trump: (01:41:09)
Thank you.
Audience: (01:41:09)
We love you.
Donald Trump: (01:41:09)
Thank you very much.
Audience: (01:41:11)
We love you, we love you.
Donald Trump: (01:41:20)
Greatest movement in the history of our country. And it’s never even challenged when I say that. The fake news never says, “Well, it’s not really true there was a movement.” There’s nothing they can say. There’s never been a movement like this. I remember one politician many years ago, came in second in a certain state. And he became famous for many, many years because he came in second. We won 34 states. We did a job that nobody’s ever done. There’s never been anything like it. You are the people that built this country. We’re not going to take that away. You are the people that built this country. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. God bless you. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you very much. I’ll see you soon. Thank you.

			Donald Trump: (03:37)
We have great, great people running. Many of them are right here. I love Marjorie. With your help, we’re going to take back the House and send Nancy Pelosi back to San Francisco where she can work very hard to bring back a city which she has helped to very much destroy, just like they’re destroying our nation. They’re destroying our nation. We’re going to fire your ultra left-wing Senator Ralph Warnock, and elect the great Herschel Walker to the United States Senate. And we’re going to take back our country from these lunatics.
Donald Trump: (04:23)
In just eight months Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are well on their way to turning America into a third-world nation. That’s what’s happening. You see it here as much as anybody. I told you so during the election and during the campaign. Inflation is skyrocketing. Unemployment is rising at a level that nobody can believe. Main streets are being boarded up. Murders are through the roof. You look at what’s happening in these Democrat-run cities. Violent gangs or drugged-out vagrants are taking over our big cities, our once great cities. Corruption is rampant. The senior ranks of our military have been politicized. Our leaders are issuing unconstitutional executive mandates and our country is being turned into a migrants camp. That’s what we are. Other than that, how are things going?
Crowd: (05:24)
USA. USA. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. USA. USA. USA.
Donald Trump: (05:52)
It’s really not even believable what’s going on, but it’s going on nevertheless. Each and every one of us here tonight must do everything we can to save America. We’re talking about saving. You remember, we had Make America Great Again, then I said, oh boy, now we have to do it again because what they’ve done. So we had Make America Great Again, again. Again, again. We made a great and now we’ve got to make a great again. That begins with an earth-shattering win in November 2022. And by the way, we never forget 2020, just in case you have any questions. We’re not forgetting 2020. The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024. We’re going to have a big, big, beautiful group then.
Donald Trump: (06:46)
If we have a country left in 2024, that’s the problem. We’re going to have a country left. And what they’re doing at this level, what they’re doing at this level, you’re not going to have a country left. There’s no greater crisis facing our nation today than the catastrophe on our Southern border. You’ve been watching it and a lot of the fake news. And you got a lot of them back … Look at all of those fake newspeople. Wow. It’s amazing. They’re doing our country no favor. They’re doing you no favor and they’re doing themselves no favor. American sovereignty is being extinguished by the deliberate and willful policies put in place by Joe Biden and the left-wing extremist he has installed in power. I don’t know if Joe is exactly involved. I don’t know. I don’t know. I really don’t. But somebody is really screwing up our country and destroying our country. In Del Rio, Texas, you’ve been watching tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have overrun our borders in recent days while laughing in the faces of our border patrol agents. And they’re going after the riders of the horses, not the people that came in illegally. Isn’t that incredible? And they’ve just put them under watch. They’re in big trouble, the riders of those horses. Most people would say they were doing one hell of a job, right? Don’t you agree? They’re in trouble, can you believe it?
Donald Trump: (08:24)
One thing is certain, this would never, ever be happening if I were your president and we should have been your president. 75 million votes. When I was in the White House, illegal aliens knew that if they broke our laws and trespassed across our borders, they would be caught, they would be detained, and they would be thrown out of our country very rapidly. So they didn’t come. They didn’t come because it was not worth the trip and then you have to go back. It wasn’t worth the trip.
Donald Trump: (08:56)
When they made the statement, come with open arms, the world is coming into our country. They’re emptying their prisons into our country. I used to say from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, but now it’s from many countries all over the world, including the Middle East, they’re emptying their prisons into our country. We’re having people coming into our country that we do not want. We do not want. Under my administration, we ended catch and release. We shut down asylum for it. We struck historic agreements with Mexico and Central American nations to stop illegal immigration and we deported dangerous criminal aliens by the tens of thousands, including MS-13 killers. We got them out by the thousands. We built almost 500 miles of powerful border wall. And it was tough because we had to go through two and a half years of litigation against Democrats that were suing us, including Congress. We created the most secure border in the history of the United States of America.
Donald Trump: (10:12)
And the wall could have been finished in a month. They didn’t want to finish the wall. This is not even believable. It took us … We were building at record rates, but we had to get the approval from the courts. Two and a half years of fighting and winning 11 different cases. Now, Joe Biden is thrown the border wide open and our country is being invaded by hundreds of thousands of people every single month. Every month, we have hundreds of thousands of people coming, and we don’t even see the people that are really coming in. And I guarantee you, they’re the worst of all. According to one report, over 220 miles of the area near Del Rio is now completely and completely, totally just absorbed by people, but totally unpatrolled.
Donald Trump: (11:02)
By people, but totally unpatrolled. The police are saying, “What do we do? This is an invasion.”
Crowd: (11:16)
Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the Wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall.
Donald Trump: (11:28)
He could finish that wall in one month. And the contractors are all suing now. They’re going to make more money. They have contracts to build the wall, finish the wall. They said, “Terminate. Let’s terminate. First day, we’re going to terminate.” And now the contracts are going to get more money for not building than they ever got for building. You got some contractors over here. They’re laughing, because they know exactly what I’m saying. Don’t you? Biden terminated our asylum agreements, instituted nationwide catch and release, crippled ICE. These are great patriots, ICE. Tough. I wouldn’t want that job. That guy with the beautiful jacket on… Come here. Let me look at him. Look at that beautiful… Stand up in the chair. Stand up in that chair. Help him. Look at this guy.
Donald Trump: (12:17)
How many rallies have you been to?
Speaker 3: (12:19)
I’ve lost track, sir.
Donald Trump: (12:21)
Oh boy. And he’s a great guy and a great patriot. And when he takes that back off, he goes into his shirt and he probably goes back to his accounting office, but we love you. You’re great, and we appreciate your support. Really great. We appreciate it. Great guy. Great guy. But even sleepy-eyed Chuck Todd of NBC News was recently forced to admit that Biden’s open borders and his policies are acting as a magnet attracting illegal aliens from all over the planet. Yet, despite this obvious disaster, radical Democrats in the house and Senate continue to push for mass amnesty. It’s really hard to believe they think this is good when you look at what’s happening. Haiti is emptying out into our country. Haiti. They have a lot of problems in Haiti, and it’s very sad, but we’re bringing people into our country that it’s just a terrible, terrible, terrible situation.
Donald Trump: (13:23)
We’re living through the worst border crisis in the history probably of civilization. There’s no border. Nobody has a border like this. We don’t do anything. Other countries, even if they’re not well-equipped, they put up a fight. They don’t let people come in. We’re just letting them just walk right in. And your own Senator Raphael Warnock has not uttered a single solitary word of criticism, because he’s a Marxist controlled by the radical left Democrats who don’t believe in borders, and they don’t believe in a nation. And they don’t believe in our nation. I don’t believe they believe in our nation. Next year, Warnock and every single one of these far-left lunatics must be routinely and resoundingly and decisively defeated. They have to be defeated. You’re not going to have a country left. If you want to have a country left, you must elect no Democrats and vote only for America First Republicans. America first.
Donald Trump: (14:34)
We have a couple of great… We have Save America, which is great. We have a lot of different… Make America Great Again. We’ll never give that one up. Make America Great Again. I thought we could sort of put it aside for a while. But as soon as they came in, we said, “We need that one again.” But we have some good ones. But, when you think about it, some of those phrases, they’re so on. They’re so perfect. Think about Make America Great Again, Save America, America First. Think of it, America First.
Donald Trump: (15:12)
And I’ll never forget when Biden first came into office. If you can believe this, he said, “We don’t believe in America first policies. I said, “Even if you really don’t, you can’t say that. It doesn’t work.” He doesn’t believe. But it’s true. They don’t believe in America first. They don’t believe in America first policies. The world is eating our lunch. They’re laughing at us. They watch what happened in Afghanistan, and they think we’re weak and stupid. And I’ll tell you, when I was president, they respected us. They respected this country, because they were ripping us off and we stopped it. We stopped it, and we’ll go into it, too. For the last eight months, Biden, Pelosi, and the socialist Democrats have been relentlessly pushing the demented lie that their political opponents are the number one threat. Think of it. The number one threat to national security. They call them the Trump people. You know what that is? That’s 75 million people, but it’s really much more than that, much, much more than that.
Donald Trump: (16:16)
And that’s the largest vote by far ever gotten by a sitting president. No president has ever come close to it. And most presidents go down in the second term. Even if they win, they go down. Obama went down way down, but he won. Well, I don’t know. Maybe he won. Who the hell knows if he won. Nowadays with these elections, who knows if he won, but he went down a lot, and he won. Most of them go down. Some of them go up. But if they go up, they don’t go up much. We went up by 12 million votes. I was told, “Sir,” a great pollster. “So we got 63 million.” He said, “Sir, if you go up 1 million votes, you can’t lose.” Well, we went up 12 million votes, and they say we lost, but there never has been a concession. You do know that. You do.
Donald Trump: (17:17)
When Stacy Abrams says, “I’m not going to concede,” it’s okay.” No. When Stacey Abram says, “I’m not going to concede,” that’s okay. No problem. Oh, she’s not going to concede. She’s not going to concede. Of course having her, I think, might be better than having your existing governor, if you want to know what I think. Might very well be better. But when she says that, no problem. When crooked Hillary Clinton says, “Don’t ever concede,” but she conceded. Of course, I got her at three o’clock in the morning. There was something going on there.
Donald Trump: (17:56)
But she conceded. She probably regrets it, but I never conceded, because I saw what was happening and I can’t do it. I can’t do it, because I have a commitment to you, and I can’t do it. And, honestly, it would’ve been a lot easier for me if I did like every politician. “I’d like to congratulate sleepy Joe on running a brilliant race from the basement.” Somebody ran a good race. We don’t know who the hell it was. It was somebody ran a good race. But the fact is that we ran a great race. A major media group came, and they interviewed me two weeks ago. They go, “Sir, what was the difference between 2016 and 20 20?” They meant that as a negative question. I said, “Well, let me tell you the difference. We did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.” We did much better.
Donald Trump: (18:56)
We did much better. The rallies were bigger. There were more enthusiasts. We did much, much better. We got 12 million more votes. I mean, we went from 63 to 75 million. And the person said, “I never thought of that. I never.” He wasn’t that bad. He was radical left, but he wasn’t that bad. But he did say, “I followed your campaign. It was the most incredible campaign I’ve ever witnessed. Where you would get up and do three, four and five of these rallies a day, and you did that for 30 days before the election.” He said, “I’ve never seen anything like that.” And he said, “There has never been anything like that in the history of politics in this country, and probably in the history of politics in the world. There’s never been a movement like this.” I said, “Are you going to write that?”
Donald Trump: (19:51)
He said, “Probably not.” He said, “Probably not.” And the reason not is his bosses probably wouldn’t let him write that. But there has never been a movement, a MAGA movement, like this. There’s never been anything like it. Never been anything… But they said, “What’s the difference?” And I said, “We did better in 2020.” Joe Biden is not merely a threat to our national security. He’s actively demolishing it before our very eyes. Biden triggered millions of illegal aliens to rush our borders in the middle of a global pandemic, in the middle of the pandemic. Where’s your mask? Where’s your mask? Where’s your mask?
Donald Trump: (20:33)
Where’s that mandate? Why are they imposing a mandate? I mean, they oppose a mandate on everybody, but not the people coming in. In Afghanistan, he humiliated our nation with the most appalling display of incompetence by an American president in history. 13 great young warriors were murdered, and many injured, and a total of 170 people were killed with many very, very badly wounded. In their memory tonight, we have 13 empty seats of honor right here in the front row. Our hearts go out to the families of every service member that we have lost that I’ve spoken to a lot of them. And these are great, great people. Thank you. And we’re also honored to be joined by one of the marines who bravely served in Kabul during the withdrawal and helped evacuate children over the airport and over the airport wall. You saw him. He did a great job. Lance Corporal Hunter Ian Clark. Lance Corporal, come up here. Come up here.
Donald Trump: (22:04)
Come up. Handsome guy. Hunter comes from a military family and went to school right here in Perry, Georgia. Can you believe that? Come on up here. Thank you. Do you want to say something? Go ahead.
Lance Corporal Hunter Clark: (22:26)
Hey, my name’s Lance Corporal Hunter Clark. I’m here from Warner Robins, Georgia. I am the guy that pulled the baby over the wall, and it’s definitely, probably one of the greatest things I’ve ever done in my entire life. I just want to thank all the support from all y’all. It really means a lot, and I’m glad to be home now today. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (22:51)
Thank you Hunter very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, Perry, Georgia did a good job. They did a good job. You grow them well in Perry, Georgia. Biden surrendered, our forts and air base in Bagram. We were going to keep the air base because it’s right next to China and their military institutions and their installations and they have a lot of things surrounding it, and we had this big, beautiful air base that caused billions of dollars to build and we were gone. We didn’t even turn out the lights. And one day we were gone and you know who’s looking at it now and who’s all over it? China. We were never leaving that. We had a perfect plan and they were listening to us. Abdul Abdul. You can’t shoot our soldiers.
Donald Trump: (24:06)
You know what? For 18 months we didn’t have one soldier killed. They listened to me. I said, you can’t do it, Abdul. We’ll hit you harder than you’ve ever been hit. You can’t do it, and he understood that and he left us alone and we would’ve never moved our military out first. We would’ve never. They would’ve gone last. First, Americans then are people that deserve to come out of which, by the way, the people that came out are not the ones that they were talking about. That was just like a mad rush. But Abdul understood that he was not going to do anything to us. And we would’ve taken our soldiers out last. We would’ve bombed our five bases and we were going to occupy Bagram for a long time to come and it would’ve been so good, but this guy, they just took the military out first. That’s like the captain of the ship, much more severe. By the way, if a captain of a ship goes, you say, all right, he didn’t have guts, but it’s not going to affect it too much.
Donald Trump: (25:08)
They took the military out first, and that’s why you have those 13 empty seats right there. That’s why because they took the military out first and they created a void. And the Taliban said, what’s going on? I can just see Abdul. He gets a call or a message. It said, the military has left. He said, you’re nuts in their language. There’s no way. Sir, the military has left. They’ve abandoned. They’ve surrendered. They’ve quit, whatever the hell he said. And I guarantee, he said, there’s no way that happened. Nobody could be that stupid. They’re smart. They’re good fighters. The Taliban, the Afghans generally are very good fighters, very good, among the best actually. And they said, no, no, he it. And they sent a group in and they said, you know what? The military’s not there anymore. That’s why we had to bring people in that weren’t even familiar with all of it.
Donald Trump: (26:09)
They brought those 13 great people and many that are wounded, very seriously wounded. They brought them in among others. This Millie is an idiot. I got to know him. He’s an idiot. Okay. They moved the military out first. Let’s get the military out, and then after that, we’ll negotiate for hostages. Okay. And let’s leave them $85 billion in America’s finest weapons and latest equipment, and he abandoned hundreds of American citizens in enemy occupied territory, and the press is trying to play the whole situation down like it never took place because they are among the most corrupt people in this country.
Donald Trump: (26:58)
You don’t even see it anymore about Afghanistan. They don’t talk about it. They don’t talk about it, but I will. The Democrats are after me with prosecutors and everything else they can think of. They want to make sure that I just be quiet, but you know what? They want to silence me just like they’ve silenced so many others. It’s one of the reasons we don’t get the support we should from a lot of very good Republicans, but they’re not as brave as they have to be. And others are in agreement with us, but they’re afraid. The people we are dealing with are evil and angry and destroying our country. They’re destroying our country and they want to go after me because they think a big mouth. I don’t have a big mouth. You know what I have? I have a mouth that tells the truth. I have a mouth that wants to save our country. Now, Biden is bringing into the United States tens of thousands of unvetted, unscreened Afghan nationals who never worked with the Americans before, including those with child brides. They have a child bride, 13, 14 years old, and we’re going to resettle them, I guess, with the child bride. Are they doing that with the child bride? A lot of those people that rushed the planes are not the people that worked with us. They’re people that wanted to get out. You’re going to see some bad things happen over the coming years. It’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (28:37)
In just the last few days, one Afghan national arriving in our country has been charged with sexually assaulting a child, another with strangling and beating his wife, and in New Mexico, a great, great place, by the way, a group of male Afghan evacuees reportedly ganged up on a female American service member and brutally assaulted her. Ask Germany, how are they doing? They’re not too happy. Ask Sweden, how are they doing? They want to tell you the nice Liberal way, but it’s not working out too well. Biden terminated our very hard fort for travel ban. You remember the travel ban? We don’t want people coming from countries that want to destroy us. Okay. It’s pretty simple.
Donald Trump: (29:28)
On terrorist occupied countries that we went through the entire system to defend and won in this Supreme Court of the United States. This travel ban went on for two years of litigation, and I ended up winning in the Supreme Court of the United States. It was very tough because all it says is people that want to blow up our stores and blow up our streets and our cities, people that want to hurt people, people that don’t love our country, we don’t want you in the United States. That’s the travel ban. And Biden is drastically increasing the number of so-called refugees who would be resettled in America and all over American communities all over next year. He’s expanding that number, but the travel ban was so strong. It was so good. When a country was angry at us, when they were bad, when they had people that wanted to blow our streets up and our stores up and set stores on fire and set our cities burning, we had a travel ban. We said, no, thank you. You can keep them. We’re not letting them in. He is now officially ended the travel ban. It’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (30:42)
He’s doing nothing to hold a Chinese Communist Party accountable for unleashing the virus upon the world. Biden did not even say the word China in his UN speech because he’s too compromised to take them on, and he only briefly mentioned Afghanistan because his withdrawal has been such a disaster for him and our country, and by the way, for his poll numbers, which have tanked. In short, after just eight months, Joe Biden is already the biggest failure ever to occupy the Oval Office, and I can think of a couple of people. I’ll tell you what, Jimmy Carter is extremely happy right now. So is another president, but I won’t mention his name because there might be about three people here at that thought he was okay.
Donald Trump: (31:38)
This is what happens when you have a dishonest election. This is all about a rigged election. None of these disasters ever should have been allowed to happen. Last week, it was painstakingly revealed by Durham, you know Durham, the Durham Report, we’ve been waiting. Thank you. Thank you, Durham. Thank you. Mr. Durham, we’ve been waiting, but he came out with a big one and perhaps they’re going to come out with a lot more because this should be just the beginning.
Donald Trump: (32:08)
The Durham investigators at the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax was indeed a total scam made up by crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. How would you like to have her as your wife? No, but think of this. I mean, Bill Clinton, he’s living in fear. He’s living in fear. Now think about an evil mind like that to make up a Russia hoax. I’ll tell you a quick little story. Should I or should I just go through it? But no, it’s just sort of crazy. I kept hearing the word Russia because during my campaign before you heard about the so-called Russia hoax, people would come up with.
Donald Trump: (33:03)
Before you heard about the so-called Russia hoax, people would come up with me, and they’d say, “Sir.” My campaign people. “Sir. Do you ever hear anything about Russia?” And I’d say, “No, not really. I mean, Russia is Russia, right? They’re ripping us off just like every other country in the world.” Now, by the way, they’re really ripping us because of what they’ve done with energy. They’re making a fortune because of Biden. I ended the pipeline, and he approved it. But he knocked out the Keystone, didn’t he, huh?
Donald Trump: (33:27)
But they’d say, “Sir.” And innocent, young, great people. They love our country. “Sir.” Another one coming up a couple of months later. “Sir, did you ever hear anything? Do you ever hear anything about Russia?” “No.” Then a third one comes up a month later. “Sir. Do you have anything to do with Russia?” “No.” After about four or five times, you know the way it is. I said, “What the hell is going on with Russia?” And that’s what’s going on with Russia. They made up a hoax, and we had to live with it for three years. What kind of a sick, perverted mind does that? And it was the lawyer and Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. They made it up. It was a hoax.
Donald Trump: (34:08)
And now they’re doing it again with the January 6th. Okay? They’re doing it again. They’re doing it again. We went through three years of hell battling this fake charge that was only allowed to happen because the media was complicit, as they always are for the Democrats. And it was totally criminal, what took place. And I think you’ll be seeing a lot of things about it. But this … In other words, it is officially now a hoax. Most of you knew that from the beginning.
Donald Trump: (34:41)
And you see this guy, shifty Schiff. Adam shifty Schiff. “President Trump is a paid worker for Russia.” I said, “What the hell do I have to do with Russia?” Adam shifty Schiff. And now he’s doing it again. The same guy, the same face, that same watermelon-shaped face. You know, he wanted to be a part of the administration. They didn’t want to put him in. I give my credit to Biden on that one. He’s very, very disappointed about that. But the same guy that would get up at a microphone and say, “President Trump’s son is involved with Russia.” Call, “Don, do you have anything to do with Russia?” He didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. He thought I was crazy. Eric … And these are good kids. They work their asses off for the country. I want to tell you.
Donald Trump: (35:31)
What a shame. For three years, we went through it, and now it’s revealed that it was a total hoax. We knew it anyway, but now it’s official. They said it’s criminal. And it was paid for by the Democrats and paid for by Hillary Clinton and some others. The big Steele dossier. Remember Steele? That was written. Turned out to be a total fake document. They made up all the stories. Thank goodness, because there were a couple in there that I didn’t like. And the lawyers for the Democrat party, Michael Sussmann. He was just fired, and he was just fired and arrested for what he did. And you have another one, Mark Elias. He’s no longer with Perkins Coie, which is the big law firm that the Democrats … I guess they probably got him the hell out of there because it was getting too hot. It’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (36:33)
And let me tell you something. Just like they tried on the 2016 election with a totally fabricated con job, what they did in 2020 was far worse, far worse, and much more sophisticated, more highly sophisticated. They worked on this for four years, and we were given a few weeks to find out what they did. We knew it was fake. We knew what they were doing, but we were given a very small part of time. We didn’t get any help from Mitch McConnell. We didn’t get any help from that guy.
Donald Trump: (37:07)
They attacked and cheated on our elections, and they did it right here in Georgia also, right here in Georgia. Now the people of Georgia must replace the RINOs and weak Republicans who made it all possible. In particular, your incompetent and strange … There’s something wrong with this guy. Your secretary of state. Raffensperger. Raffensperger. I’m telling you, I think there’s something wrong with him. And we give him so much. Could you look at this? Could you look at that? Election integrity. Could you? And sometimes, “Yes, I’m going to look at.” Nothing ever happens. Raffensperger. Something really strange with him. Your terrible lieutenant governor who’s no longer running because he knew that he wasn’t doing a job. He was going to lose. And your RINO governor, Brian Kemp, who’s been a complete disaster on election integrity, a complete and total … And I’m not looking to say that. I’m not looking to say that. He’s been a complete and total disaster on election integrity. If you go in with a complaint about election integrity, you get investigated instead of investigating a crooked election. It’s the craziest. And some of you know this story, I was called by a very good friend of mine who happens to be here tonight. Sir, could you please endorse? I think we’re 148 and two with endorsements. They like my endorsement. It’s never happened before. Sir, could you please endorse Brian Kemp? I said, “Who the hell is Brian Kemp?” This is at the beginning. There were four or five. I think it’s five. But there were five guys, five people running, five men were running, and he was in last place doing poorly, and I made the mistake.
Donald Trump: (39:05)
I listened to this gentleman who’s a great guy, actually. And I said, “How well do you know him?” “Well.” “Did he ever say anything bad about me?” You know when they say bad things about me, I have a tendency not to endorse them, okay? Sometimes I do because it’s better than a Democrat, right? But I said, “Did he ever say anything bad?” We checked, and it was nothing bad. He hadn’t been too deep into politics, I guess. Otherwise, he probably would have. But he didn’t say anything bad. I said, “You know what? I’ll endorse him.” I endorse Brian Kemp.
Donald Trump: (39:37)
The primary was like immediately following the endorsement, immediately. And he won. He ends up going from last place or just about last place to winning in a landslide. Then I had to get him pass good old Stacey. I had to get him past Stacey. He got it. He said, ” Sir.” We had I guess two rallies. One had 52,000 people. One had 49,000 people. The big monster rallies at the airport because no arena could hold the people. And they weren’t there for him. They were there for me. And Stacey Abrams, who still has not conceded, and that’s okay. Stacey, would you like to take his place? It’s okay with me. She still has not conceded, but we had, just so you understand, we had the most incredible rallies, the most incredible rallies. And I said, “Brian, you’re going to win.” “Oh, I don’t think so.” “No, you’re going to win. I’m telling you.” And he ended up winning by like two points, right? And then when I called him about election integrity, it’s like, “I’m sorry, sir. I can’t do that.” I said, “No, no.”
Donald Trump: (00:00)
Yeah, actually, it was very interesting. I called my people. I said, “We got to find out what happened with this election, because there’s something wrong with this election,” as you obviously know, and by, other than the fake news, has been covered pretty good. But if these guys would come back, young guys, “Sir, we spoke to Governor Kemp. Sir, he will not do anything on election integrity.” I said, “No. Just call him again.” I mean, maybe he never got the message. They come back the next day, “Sir, Governor Kemp won’t do anything on election integrity.” Remember we wanted to call a special election, so that we could go, Marjorie, into election integrity. What is wrong with that? And he said, ‘No, we won’t.” And I think the governor is the only one that can call it.
Donald Trump: (00:51)
And he wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. So when these guys, they’re young and nice guys, they came back, they said. “He won’t do it.” So I said, “Let me handle it. This is easy.” I got this guy elected. One thing has nothing to do with the other. One thing has nothing… There’s no quid pro quo. You remember that word from the fake Ukraine deal. The fake Ukraine… We had Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. They were both fake deals. Okay? I got impeached twice on fake news, but I said to these young people, “Let me handle it.” I was going to show them how good I am. “Let me handle it. I’ll call them up.” I said, “Brian, listen. you have a big election integrity problem in Georgia. I hope you can help us out and call a special election and let’s get to the bottom of it for the good of the country.
Donald Trump: (01:39)
Let’s get to the bottom of it for the good of your state. Let’s go election integrity. What could be better than that? “Sir, I’m sorry. I cannot do that.” I said, “Whoa.” I said you cannot do that.” And that’s why… Let me tell you, this guy’s a disaster. He’s a disaster. They ignore… and just, he’s been a real horrible… I could have anybody else… You have another bad one, by the way. You have another bad one, Ducey in Arizona. He’s another beauty, but not as bad as what you have here. Not as bad. They ignored monumental evidence of rampant fraud. We’ve all seen the video of ballots being pulled out from under the tables after kicking out all of the observers. Remember that? Based on a made-up story of “Sir, there’s a major water main break clean out.” Water main break that never happened.
Donald Trump: (02:36)
Remember they said, Water main break, everybody get out.” And then the people came back in, and they were stuffing, stuffing, stuff. But supposedly caused the vote counting to be shut down for hours and hours. So everyone was out except for these people that were on tape. In addition, Brian Kemp, Raffensperger, and your state leaders surrendered Stacey Abrams. They totally surrendered to her. I think he’s afraid of Stacey Abrams. I don’t understand that. Stacy, you have a great team. Okay? We talked about that, but I saw him being interviewed by Laura Ingram, who’s fantastic, and he was interviewing… although it was a very soft interview on this case, but she’s fantastic. And I don’t say he’s a man of large stature. I’m being very nice. And he said, “I love football.” And she said, “What position do you play?” “I’m an offensive tackle in high school.”
Donald Trump: (03:34)
Now, even in high school, he was not an offensive tackle. Somehow I remembered that. I don’t know why. Herschel say, “What the hell was that all about, sir?” He’s not an offensive tackle, but your state leaders surrendered to Stacey Abrams and allowed themselves to be bullied into a disastrous consent decree that effectively abolished signature verification and paved the way for massive fraud. And they don’t want to do anything about it. They don’t. I’ll tell you, a couple of people do and their legislators and they’re here right now, but they didn’t want to do anything about it. And the agreement was never approved by the state legislature anyway. It wasn’t even approved. Just recently, it was reported your state, this isn’t Arizona now, this is the great state of Georgia. It was reported that 43,000 absentee ballot votes were counted in DeKalb County that violated the chain of custody rules.
Donald Trump: (04:35)
Now you have to remember that Georgia was decided by only 11,779 votes, so I only needed one more vote than that to win the election. But we have many, many more votes than we needed to win the election. I recently sent the Georgia Secretary of State a letter outlining the glaring issue, and I’ve never gotten a response. Somebody said, “They’re looking at me for questioning the election.” That’ll be an interesting one. Let’s go after Trump, because he’s questioning the election. If I won or lost, all I want is a fair election. That’s all you want. But I have no doubt that we won, and we won big.
Donald Trump: (05:27)
There are… Listen to these numbers. These are Georgia numbers and these come from the state, they told me. I said, “Are you sure these numbers are right?” They said, “They’re right.” So let me apologize if they’re not, but they are right. There are 10,300 individuals in Georgia who moved more than 30 days before the November election to a different county in Georgia but failed to reregister and vote in their current county of residence. That means their votes don’t count, but the votes counted. There are 4,052 individuals who voted but whose names do not appear on the Georgia registered voter list. Oh, that’s a little bit of a problem. There are 18,325 individuals in Georgia who voted whose addresses are recorded, or the US Postal Service says, vacant. They’re vacant. It’s vacant.
Donald Trump: (06:22)
During the hand recount falsified tally sheets were discovered showing unanimous votes and votes counted exclusively for Joe Biden. Ballot images obtained through a public records request revealed duplicated votes, which included at least 3,390 extra votes for Joe Biden. In Fulton County, 100,000 tally sheets for mail-in ballots were missing for months following the election. Oh gee, I wonder how that happened. Georgia officials also took $45 million from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to fund election related activities.
Crowd: (07:10)
Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.
Donald Trump: (07:10)
Well, they shouldn’t be looking at that. What is that all about? Over 90% of this funding they say for the November election was given to Democrat areas of the state and used to boost Democrat voter turnout. What’s that all about? You know, they have a limit of like $5,200. He’s given millions and millions of dollars to different states, not only Georgia. Among other things, that’s for the famous drop boxes that you hear about where a vast percentage of the votes in the unlocked and unguarded boxes were for Biden. They were for Biden, even though we know who most of them were for. According to True the Vote, great group, at least 7% of the drop box vote was illegally trafficked. That’s 92,000 votes in the Atlanta metropolitan area alone. That’s 92,000. Remember, we’re talking about little more than 11,000. 92,000. That’s one of many categories.
Donald Trump: (08:10)
In addition, a new investigation by True the Vote, very respected group, alleges a gigantic illegal ballot harvesting operation involving large numbers of people throughout the state. With all of these discrepancies and criminal acts, Governor Kemp and Raffensperger and your attorney general, who unfortunately has not decided to get involved other than looking at people that are questioning the votes, aren’t interested in the people that committed the voter fraud. They’re only interested in me and others, because I bring voter fraud to the forefront in order to save our nation from corrupt elections and to make sure that this never ever happens again. Never happens again. Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me, but no one is willing to give us the information we want in Fulton County. And Fulton county has a terrible reputation for voter corruption, probably among the worst in the country. They say I’m being aggressive, but you have to be aggressive to weed out this horrible election corruption. You have to be aggressive. In truth, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I just happened to be in the way. That’s what’s really happening. Yesterday, we also got the results of the Arizona audit, which were so disgracefully reported by those people back there. And the headlines claiming that Biden won. That Biden won. Our fake news at a very big lie. They like to… You ever notice when they write about that, they will say, “While the election results are a big lie,” every reporter, it’s just total misinformation. “While they’re totally unfounded,” everything’s unfounded, big lie, not correct. “While Trump has no reason to say this.” I mean, we got piles and piles of information, affidavits by the thousands and thousands. It’s a disgrace. We won on the Arizona forensic audit yesterday at a level that you wouldn’t believe. And what I’m going to do is I’m going to read off for you their results, right from their page. These are very talented people, yet it’s so difficult, because the Washington Post the New York Times and virtually every mainstream media source, CNN, forget it, they’re so dishonest… By the way, their ratings are down 81%. Would you say this?
Donald Trump: (11:07)
And, likewise, CNBC and, likewise, those crooked newscasts… And, by the way, Greg Gutfeld is number one in the evening now, and he’s on cable and he’s great, but he’s number one. He’s beaten… Because people, they’re not funny. These people aren’t funny. Frankly, I think they’re sick. There’s nothing funny about them, but you have a cable person beating all these guys with all that money. I hope Fox is going to pay Greg what they’re making, add it up together. That’s what I did on the apprentice. I said, “I have higher ratings than all these big stars on the apprentice.” I said to NBC at the time, “They loved me so much during the apprentice. They went bad.” Well, they didn’t want me to run. They didn’t want me to run. They said, “Please, another three years, another five. We’ll do whatever.”
Donald Trump: (11:53)
They did not want me to run. They said, “You won’t win. Why would you give up a primetime show that’s doing so well?” And then I did it and look what happened. My life was so simple. My life was so simple. I should have just… But what we’ve done is so important. What we’ve exposed is so important. What we’re doing, and what we’re going to do, is going to be the most important of all. But they had headlines that Biden wins in Arizona when they know it’s not true. He didn’t win in Arizona. He lost in Arizona based on the forensic audit. And some people say, and I understand this and I have great, great friends that really want what’s best for us, they say, “Sir, you’re leading in every poll by numbers like nobody’s ever seen before. Think to the future, not to the past.”
Donald Trump: (13:02)
And I say, “If we don’t think about the past, you’ll never win again in the future, because it’s all rigged.” It’s all rigged. I understand what they’re saying, but it’s all rigged. And it’s a massive disinformation campaign by the corrupt and very fake media. It’s a disinformation. So here’s what they say. Here’s what they say. You ready? This is from the report. How do we look up there? Okay? Not bad. Let’s say, wow. That’s a nice screen. Who the hell else gives you a screen like that? So here’s from the report. This is from the forensic audit by very respected people. And it was a very, very conservatively done reports, much worse than this. The astounding findings include… Ready? 23,344 mail-in ballots were counted despite the person no longer living in that address. Oh, that’s good. So they mailed in, but there’s nobody living there. 23,000. The entire margin in the state was only 10,457 of us. I remember this, because each one of these categories are more than you need. More than you need.
Donald Trump: (14:27)
So you have a little over 10,000 votes that I quote “lost by.” But all these things happened. There were 17,322 duplicate ballots, which renowned computer scientist Dr. Shiva identified as having surged right after the election was over. Between November 4th and November 9th scores of mail-in ballot duplicates emerged. Duplicates. You know what a duplicate is, right? Oh, how did that happen? 96% of the ballots that came in on two of these days were duplicates.
Donald Trump: (15:03)
… that came in on two of these days were duplicates. There were 2,382 votes who voted in person even though they had moved out of the county. 2081 voters had moved out of the state. They’re not allowed to vote, but they voted anyway. 5,047 people, remember a little over 10,000, 11… think of that. I mean, just give that a little thought. Every one of these numbers. 5,047 people voted in more than one county resulting in up to 5,295 what they call overvotes. It’s an overvote. In other words, you’re supposed to vote in one county, not two. How many people voted in three or four? I wonder.
Donald Trump: (15:47)
There were at least 282 dead people who happened to vote. Maricopa County’s official canvas recorded 3,432 more ballots cast than people they recorded as having cast a vote. That’s tough, right? 277 precincts have more ballot cast than people. They have more ballots cast than they have people resulting in at least 1,551 excess votes. 9,041 mail-in votes and voters. Well, just to be exact. You know what? We have to get this exactly accurate because the fake news will say, “He said votes, instead of voters.” 9,041 mail-in voters returned more ballots than they were sent. Oh, that’s interesting. How does that happen?
Donald Trump: (16:42)
Then this is from a canvasing report that was done by a very respected group. 255,326, remember, you’re talking about a little over 10,000 votes. 255,326 early votes do not have a corresponding record in the county’s voter file. Oh, that’s interesting. 284,412 ballots and ballot images were “corrupt or missing.” This is from their report. I didn’t write this report. This is findings. They call it findings. Then the fake news said that I lost. We lost by a little over 10,000. Hundreds of thousands of votes we’re talking about.
Donald Trump: (17:29)
All of this was found without being given access to the routers, which county officials ruthlessly withheld. They didn’t want to give those routers under any circumstances. They had to be fought all the way. The county, the people that run the county, they fought us every, not me. They fought the Senate. They fought the Senate of Arizona and the Governor Ducey was horrible. He was missing in action. He was actually against it. Nonetheless, the auditors discovered that millions of election-related files were deleted during and after the election in violation of federal law, including a purge of the “election management system.” That’s a quote, “election management system” software the day before the audit began.
Donald Trump: (18:20)
The audit’s going to now begin. They went to court. The same guy that I guess got fired. Something happened to him, Elias. He went to court. They sent in 107 lawyers to fight us on this, to fight the people, to fight the Senate, 107. Oh, she said 170. That could be right. All these lawyers, they just emerged one day in Arizona, all the court cases, and the Senate hung in and they won. In addition, in another effort led by patriot Liz Harris, the Maricopa County canvassing results for Arizona were just published. Is Liz Harris here? No way. Why do you like Liz Harris so? What the hell do you know about Liz? Huh? She’s a patriot.
Donald Trump: (19:06)
Biden supposedly won the state of Arizona by 10,457 votes. Yet, the report shows 173,104 lost votes and 96,389 ghost votes. You know what a ghost vote is, right? Where is it? Where is it? Harris stated that a conservative estimate of votes impacted was 299,493. It is estimated that 173,104 voters had their votes stolen. Look at those lights going out over there. Oh my God. The lights, I’m telling you, the television lights are going out. This is the most interesting part of the speech. The rest of my speech, you’ve sort of heard before, right? Regarding ghost votes, Maricopa County recorded and estimated 96,000 mail-in votes that could not have been physically cast by the voter that the vote was registered to, could not have been done by the voter that it was registered to. 96,000. That’s nine times more than I need right there. That’s just one little category. The media aren’t reporting this stuff. They’re saying that the election results are fine. It’s going, it’s just not acceptable.
Donald Trump: (20:36)
Just like they don’t want to talk about Afghanistan or Hunter Biden’s corruption. That’s the other thing that came out today. You see that? They delayed the Hunter Biden corruption because they didn’t want it to hurt Joe Biden’s chances of election. Look what happened with Joe Biden as your President. Our country has gone to hell.
Speaker 1: (21:47)
We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump.
Donald Trump: (21:48)
Thank you. I love you too. You’re incredible people. You’re incredible people. They’re trying to take our country away, and they’re trying to steal our country, and they’re going to ruin our country. Once it’s destroyed, remember I used to say, we will not become Venezuela. This is what’s happening. Now this is what’s happening. You take a look at Venezuela. They can’t get water. They can’t get anything. They’re living in hell. We will not be a socialist country. How many times have I said it? This will not be Venezuela. This is going to be Venezuela very soon if they keep going the way they’re going. This is all done in a period of less than nine months.
Donald Trump: (22:26)
Think of it. This destruction of our border, all of the destruction, our military in retreat, we’ve never had a military retreated before. Why would you leave 83 or 85 billion dollars worth of equipment? Why would you leave brand new blackhawk helicopters, the greatest machine? Why would you leave millions and millions? Why as an example? There was no reason. We had it so under control. We were getting the hell out there, but everybody would’ve come out. We would’ve then taken the equipment. I even gave an expression. I want every screw, every bolt, every nail. I want the tents that the equipment has had. I want everything.
Donald Trump: (23:10)
Milley said to me one time. I’ll never forget it. “Sir, it’s more expensive. It’s more expensive, sir, to take the equipment than to leave it.” I said, “Really, you mean you have a $10 million tank. You put it on a plane and that’s more expensive than leaving it?” He said, “It’s more expensive.” And I never forgot that statement because that’s probably the first time I realized that he was stupid. But you know what I did say? I said, “We have brand new aircraft just out of the factory. It’s sitting on the runways and our soldiers are fleeing and surrendering to guys with knives.” Good fighters, by the way. But guys with knives that I got along with very well. They understood. They’re not going to screw around. I almost used the F word. It would’ve been more effective if I did, but they would’ve … he used a horrible word. So I didn’t do it. Remember I didn’t do it.
Donald Trump: (24:04)
It would’ve been so much more effective if I used the word. Maybe later on, but with Milley and with all these people, they flee. I said, “Why wouldn’t you have brought in 200 pilots, 200? We have the best pilots in the world. We have the best soldiers in world. We have the best military in the world.” I rebuilt the military. Space force. Don’t forget space force. I rebuilt. Why wouldn’t you bring over real fast?
Donald Trump: (24:36)
First of all, you shouldn’t have left anything behind. I don’t even like this idea, but assuming they really wanted to leave it behind because they’re stupid, why wouldn’t you bring over 200 pilots? Just take the planes and fly them to Pakistan. Then you bring them over or fly them to some other country of which we give them all so much money that they all treat us well. Okay. We get ripped off by everybody, but why wouldn’t you fly the planes out? They said they’d leave the planes.
Donald Trump: (25:02)
Then they said because they were so embarrassed because they probably didn’t even know what they were doing, they had no idea what they were doing. They said, “No, well, we disabled it.” You know what they did? They let the air out of a couple of tires of one plane. They didn’t disable anything. These guys have the best equipment anywhere in the world. They’re probably the best armed soldiers and equipped soldiers in the world. They have goggles, the likes of which nobody, the night goggles, they call them. I can see at night better than I can at 12:00 in the afternoon with the sun. That’s how good they are. Better than our soldiers have, the latest models. And they have thousands and thousands. They have hundreds of thousands of rifles and weapons and machine guns. Hundreds of, we left it there. There was no reason to leave it there.
Donald Trump: (25:47)
We could have taken a year, two years, four years or two months to get the hell out. There was no reason. We had them so at bay. They weren’t going to play games because they knew that if they did, they were going to get hit harder than any nation has ever been hit at their home because it’s all about their home. Because they were never hit at their home, but we know where their homes are, and we were going to hit them very hard. They understood that. That’s why I told you before, 18 months we didn’t have one soldier killed. And even Biden said that it was a mistake. He said, “Well, I will say that no soldiers have been killed in 18 months.” And his people are screaming at him. “Don’t say that you stupid son of a bitch.”
Donald Trump: (26:29)
He was supposed to add a but, but something bad. But he didn’t do that. As a result of the Arizona forensic audit, 41 legislators from across the nation wrote an open letter to the American people calling for audits in all 50 states and decertification of the election where appropriate. A total decertification. It is clear in Arizona that they must decertify the election. You heard the numbers, and those responsible for wrongdoing must be held accountable. It was a corrupt election. It’s my opinion, by the way, that Georgia is far worse.
Donald Trump: (27:35)
Hopefully the Arizona attorney general, a good man, will do far more for his state than your attorney general has done for your state because your attorney general has not done what he’s supposed to be doing. What he’s supposed to be doing is free and clear and non-corrupt elections. They’re not doing that. We must elect strong, brave America first leaders who will be true champions for the people and for free, fair and honest elections. We must demand election integrity at all costs. If we don’t have borders, if we don’t have elections, if we don’t have our military back and strong, I rebuilt the military and now look what happens. They’re giving it away to the enemy. To think 28 Apache helicopters. You don’t know. I hate to use the term, but it’s considered, I didn’t want to use it before. I said machine, but it’s considered the most incredible killing machine. That’s a horrible term, right? But it’s the most incredible killing machine.
Donald Trump: (28:37)
When a tank sees an Apache helicopter over the horizon, lifting up, you know what happens to that tank operator? He gets the hell out of there because he doesn’t have a chance. They hit it with a missile right down the middle of the gun. They hit it with a missile right down that barrel. They go, boom. That goes right in from 5, 6, 7 miles away. The tank shoots at them and it’s going like this and they’re waving. Hello? Goodbye. Bing, bing, bing. They take out a lot of them at a time. They got brand new ones. They got to learn to fly them but they will. They will. The Chinese will teach them. The Russians will teach ’em.
Donald Trump: (29:14)
We have a few of those leaders here tonight. Some really great leaders, including your next Secretary of State. A friend of mine, somebody has done a phenomenal job. Jody Hice. Jody, come here. Jody is running against one of the worst Secretary of States in America, rhino, Brad Raffensperger who’s trying to turn the tables on me because I’m fighting for election integrity. Come on up here, Jody, come on. This guy’s a great Congressman. He didn’t need this, and I’ll say this for him. I didn’t call him. He’s a Congressman. I would’ve said, “Well, what the hell are you leaving?” He’s in a district where they love him, where he wins easily. Nobody challenges him. He said, “I have to do this for the good of my state. I have to do this. I have to do this for the good of-”
Donald Trump: (30:03)
… For the good of my state, I have to do this. I have to do this for the good of my country. He told me that. To be honest, I was surprised. Here’s a congressman whose loved in his district, whose got no problems, no election problems. He could be there forever. And he said, “I want to do this because what’s happened to the state of Georgia is a disgrace.” Say a couple of words, Jody, please. Thank you.
Rep. Jody Hice: (30:25)
Nobody understands the disaster of the lack of election integrity like the people of Georgia. Now is our hour to take it back. We’ve got incredible leadership from President Trump, and we need this kind of leadership again. Mr. President, thank you for your endorsement for me, and running for Secretary of State. The greatest president in our lifetime. A greatest fighter of our lifetime. God bless you, sir. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Donald Trump: (31:01)
Thank you, Jody. He’s a great man. Great, great gentleman. Jody, you had it made. You just could have stayed where you were. I don’t know, Jody. That’s what we love about you. He loves his state. He loves his state. We’re also delighted to be joined by your next Lieutenant Governor, a man I’ve known for a long time, a man who really did fight very, very hard for election integrity. He got shut down everywhere he went. They wanted to shut him down. They didn’t want to have election integrity. Burt Jones. Burt, come up here, Burt.
Donald Trump: (31:35)
Burt’s running to replace your Lieutenant Governor whose not running because of the poor job he’s done, especially on election reform and election integrity. Come up, Burt. Great job.
Burt Jones: (31:47)
Thank you, man. Thank you so much.
Donald Trump: (31:47)
Please, step over here.
Burt Jones: (31:55)
Don’t y’all love this man? I just want to thank you, Mr. President, for all your hard work. You continue to fight for this country, fight for our state. Thank you so much for endorsement, and I can assure you if I’d been our Lieutenant Governor, we would have gotten to the bottom of this thing.
Donald Trump: (32:14)
[crosstalk 00:32:14] no doubt.
Burt Jones: (32:15)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good bless.
Donald Trump: (32:22)
Thank you, man. Great, thank you.
Burt Jones: (32:24)
Thank you, appreciate it. Appreciate it, thank you.
Donald Trump: (32:24)
Thank you very much, Burt. Great guy. He’s another one. He loves you and he loves this state. In addition, we absolutely must take back your US Senate seat from the radical left liberal, Raphael Warnock, who nobody knew who the hell he was, and then a lot of crazy things happened. All of a sudden he’s a US Senator. How did that happen? That’s why I’m especially proud to welcome a man who truly knows how to win the United States of America, is so proud of this man. One of the greatest athletes in our country’s history. The greatest running back that I’ve ever seen. A man who played at a certain school that you love very much, and he broke every record. He broke every record.
Donald Trump: (33:18)
Come on up here, Herschel Walker. Come up here. You know, Herschel is not only a Georgia hero, he is an American legend. Herschel is a legend born and raised in this state. Herschel became one of the greatest football players of all time, and I don’t want to get in trouble, but I guarantee I watched him and he was the greatest player that Georgia ever had. As a Georgia Bulldog, he was a three time All American and a Heisman Trophy winner before going to an outstanding career in the NFL. He was great in the NFL. A lot of people don’t know as much for that, but he had a tremendous career.
Donald Trump: (34:06)
Herschel has been one of the greatest athletes in America, and I know he will go down also as one of the greatest senators in America. Herschel, please say a few words. Thank you, man. [crosstalk 00:34:18].
Herschel Walker: (34:18)
Thank you. Thank you. Well, I’ll tell you what, can you not tell this man loves the United States of America? I just want to thank him again for all you’ve done for me, not just for endorsing me for this senate run, but we’ve together for a long time. I said it a long time ago, a great man, great leader. I want to be a leader like him when I get to that senate seat to show everyone I love America. Thank you. Thank you, Georgia for welcoming our great president, the greatest president. I call him “The People’s President”, so thank you guys.
Donald Trump: (35:05)
Thank you, Herschel. Great, Herschel. What a guy. What a guy. Thank you, Herschel. Get out and really work for him. Make sure we have an honest election, too. Thank you, Herschel. Finally, I want to thank some of the other terrific republican leaders, and we have some great ones in your state that are with us tonight. A friend of mine, and a great Senator, a man who… I don’t know, are you going to run for Governor, David Perdue? Are you going to run for Governor? Where is David Perdue. Stand up, David. David Perdue, are you running for Governor, David? Did I hear he’s running for Governor? Thank you, David. He’s a great guy and he loves this state, and he’s done a fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (35:56)
Another good friend of mine right here in Perry, Georgia, Secretary and former Governor of your state for eight years. He was term-limited or he would still be here. Wouldn’t we be happy if he was? Sonny Perdue. He did a fantastic job. He did a fantastic job. They have good genes in that family. Thank you, Sonny. Great job you did in the Administration. We appreciate it. How much money did we get for the farmers? I took it all out of China, huh? I charged them hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, so we gave the farmers, what, $28 billion and we had plenty left over for the country, but we gave the farmers… The farmers didn’t know what they were doing. They never got money like this. They didn’t even want it. I had farmers come to me, “Sir, we don’t want subsidy.”
Donald Trump: (36:44)
They actually said… Nobody said that to me when I was president. The farmers did. They said, “Sir, we just want a level playing field. That’s all we want.” It’s an amazing thing, but we gave them $28 billion anyway, Sonny, and you did a fantastic job. Some real warriors that fight with me on the impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two, and many other things. They were great. Representatives Rick Allen, Rick thank you very much. Great job. Thank you, Rick. Great guy, too. Andrew Clyde. Andrew, thank you. Great job. Thank you, Andrew. Fantastic people. Austin Scott. Hi, Austin. Thank you. Great being with you a little while ago. A person whose very low key, a person who I got to know really well, a person that the press does not treat fairly. I will tell you right now just [inaudible 00:37:44], she’s really tough and she’s really, really smart. Marjorie Taylor Green.
Donald Trump: (37:57)
Very smart. They don’t like to say that, do they? She is smart as hell. She knows what’s going on. She knows what’s going on. Thank you, Marjorie and you are loved. You are loved all over the country, I will tell you that. Georgian Republican Party Chair, somebody that’s worked very closely with me and somebody that has really fought the good fight on the fraud that’s taken place in your state. He’s fighting it right now. He’s got so much information and he wants to release it. I guess he will be. Hopefully, he will be soon. He’s a wonderful guy, the Chairman, David Shafer. David, thank you. Republican Party, great job. A man who is running for Governor, who is a friend of mine, I said, “You know, you ought to be a republican.” He said, “Well, I don’t know, but I sort of like a like of republicans.” He has the view of a lot of republicans.
Donald Trump: (38:52)
He’s a good man. He’s a great guy. He’s smart. He’s tough. Vernon Jones. Vernon, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Vernon. I just heard this guy’s here. He was a tough cookie. He was a great Police Commissioner of New York. I’m looking for you, Vernon. Why are you on that side, Vernon? Good job, Vernon. Thank you very much. Thank you. See, he’s a rebel. He’s a rebel. That’s what people like about him. Thank you, Vernon. Appreciate it. A man who did a tremendous job in New York, he was a big fan of Rudy Giuliani, who’s a great guy by the way. He was the greatest mayor in the history of the city of New York, that I can tell you, and did a great job. They’d come at him with barrels. They just want to blow people away. It’s a disgrace. This is a man whose tough as hell, tough as nails, and did an incredible job in New York. He’s respected and loved by anybody and everybody. Bernie Kerik is around here someplace. Where’s Bernie? Bernie? Where’s Bernie Kerik? He’s around here. Thank you, Bernie. Great job you’ve done.
Donald Trump: (40:17)
Candidates for congress, we have some really good ones. Tonight we have Rich McCormick and Jake Evans, thank you. Thank you very much. And you’re shaking it up. I hear you’re going to do very well. Also, a friend of mine for a long time. She’s been with me when it wasn’t really fashionable, Alveda King. I want to thank you. Thank you, Alveda. She was with me when it wasn’t so good [inaudible 00:40:46]. She’s tough and she’s wonderful. She’s a wonderful woman. Thank you, Alveda. I appreciate very much your being here. This is a… Look at this crowd. Look at this crowd of patriots and the love. The love. The love they have. You know as we speak, there are people that are being held prisoner very unfairly, and that should not be allowed to happen. Or if it is going to happen, you have to treat all of the other sides, whether it’s ANTIFAH or BLM, or others that burned down our cities, you have to treat people equally. That’s one of the things we learned a long time ago.
Donald Trump: (41:32)
Of course, now they’re trying to sell different history books than we used to get, but we’re not going to let that happen. We are people, and Ashli Babbitt who was killed, she was the person that was killed during that day, that lousy day, that horrible day, but they killed Ashli Babbitt. There was no reason to kill Ashli Babbitt, no reason whatsoever. Our hearts are with that group and hopefully that’s going to all work out. I think in the end, it’s going to all work out. It’s a very, very unfair, very, very unfair situation. When you see them burning down our cities like Portland and St. Louis, and I could name city after city, Seattle, they take over Seattle. People get killed. Nothing happens to them. Then you see what happened in Washington, DC. It’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (42:23)
Under our administration, we accomplished four more years of everything. We took care of people at a level that nobody has ever thought possible. No president, and I say this, and I don’t get criticized, no president or certainly very few have accomplished what we accomplished in four years. We passed massive tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts. We ended NAFTA and the NAFTA disaster, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, who were both doing big numbers on our country but not anymore. We withdrew from the job, killing trans-Pacific partnership, stood up to China like nobody has ever stood up, taking in billions and billions of dollars from China when we never took in $0.10 from China. That’s what we were just saying with Sonny, we gave them a lot of money. $28 billion out of that money, and we had a lot left over.
Donald Trump: (43:27)
Joe Biden is just obliterating much of the hard won success that we had. We had hard won success. That success is going to have to come back, or our country doesn’t stand a chance. We’re not respected anymore as a country. We’re being laughed at all over the world. Afghanistan was the single most embarrassing event in my opinion that’s ever happened to our country. We’re being laughed at all over the world. Last month, the economy added up to one third the jobs that we expected. We expected to have much better employment numbers, and it didn’t work out too good. The unemployment rate for black Americans increased to a very, very high 8.8%. With me, they were way down and going a lot lower.
Donald Trump: (44:19)
Gas prices in Georgia are now almost 100% higher than they were just last year. You know, when gas prices go up like that, that’s like a massive tax increase. That’s bigger than a tax increase. Inflation is rampant and shortages are becoming widespread for all products. Anybody having trouble getting products? Everybody, probably. Meanwhile, Biden and Congressional democrats are pushing the largest tax increase in the history of our country. We can’t let that happen. The largest tax… It’s going to kill everything that we built. What’s happening with our country, our foundation was so strong that they were able to get away with it for a little while, but eventually those foundations will start to crumble.
Donald Trump: (45:03)
… with it for a little while, but eventually those foundations will start to crumble. Their socialist legislation would cost a mind boggling $3.5 trillion, over $10,000 from every living American. If you want high taxes, fewer jobs, vote for the radical left Democrats. If you want low taxes, more and more and more jobs, fantastic income, and freedom, vote for Republicans. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening.
Donald Trump: (45:36)
Biden and the extreme left are also using every lever of the federal government to impose woke nonsense on every facet of American life, pushing toxic, critical race theory into our children’s classrooms and even into our military, and male athletes are now being allowed to participate in women’s sports. How’s that working out? Did you see the recent weightlifting contest? How did that work out? They’re fighting for years and years over two ounces, two ounces, more. I want to get two ounces more. This guy comes along. Bing. And he wasn’t even a weightlifter, right? Yeah, it’s so crazy. It’s so unto fair to women. They fought so hard getting into this position, and it’s so unfair to women, and people don’t understand it. For four straight years, the left carried on a deranged resistance campaign, the likes of which our country has never seen before. It was a lie and another lie and lie after lie and hoax after hoax, a witch hunt after witch hunt. You saw it going with Russia, Ukraine with all of them. Now it’s worse than ever before. The same people are perpetrating these lies and these witch hunts. The same people. They get up, they have no shame. They stand up, and they talk like it’s such a horrible thing. And it’s just a disaster. Nancy Pelosi’s unselect committee of radical Democrats, a biased hit job that is wasting everybody’s time to distract from the Democrats’ epic failures. They are having epic failures. The vice chair of the unselect committee is Liz Cheney. Is everybody having … I mean, look. Our country’s embarrassed. The whole world is laughing at us. But is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Anything, right?
Donald Trump: (48:16)
In conclusion, everyone here tonight knows that the extreme left will stop at nothing to destroy the America we love and the American dream. But with all of you in Georgia and conservative patriots all across the nation, we will end their reign of radicalism in Washington DC forever. With a Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for Georgia families, fair trade for Georgia workers, and more Georgia factories forging more product stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. You don’t hear that too much. And you know, they are starting to say very strongly Merry Christmas. Remember when I first ran, I said, you’re going to say Merry Christmas. They’re all saying Merry Christmas again.
Donald Trump: (49:09)
We better move fast because that’ll end also like everything else. They want to change the name of a school in San Francisco from George Washington to something. George Washington’s name is now under attack. We don’t know what he’s done, but it must be terrible. We will shut down Joe Biden’s border disaster. We will end catch and release, and we will end illegal immigration once and for all in our country, just as I had already done very successfully more so than has ever taken place at our border. We had done it before.
Donald Trump: (49:47)
We will hold China accountable for unleashing the virus and for the unfathomable suffering they have caused and charge them trillions of dollars in reparations. We will reign in big tech monopolies, reject left wing cancel culture, and we will restore the right to free speech in America. You don’t have free speech anymore. You don’t have a free press anymore. We will protect innocent life. We will defend our constitution. We will defend the second amendment and we will proudly uphold the Judeo-Christian values and principles of our nation’s founding. We will care for our veterans, continue to strengthen our military and give our police officers border patrol. And ICE, these are great, great patriots and law enforcement generally our 100% support. They will not be defunded. We will ban critical race theory in our classrooms. We will ban it in our military. We will ban it from the workplaces, and we will ban it from our federal, state, and local governments. We will restore patriotic education for our schools, and we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
Crowd: (51:24)
USA. USA. USA.
Donald Trump: (51:43)
Our country is against some of the most sinister forces, an entrenched interest that anyone has ever seen in our country. We’ve never seen anything like is happening today. But no matter how big or powerful they may appear, you must never forget. This nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. It belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage. And our magnificent American liberty is your God given right. The citizens of the United States of America will not be told how to live, how to think, what to do or what to say by corrupt and incompetent politicians, big tech tyrants, left wing bullies, or anybody else because we are a free, proud, and sovereign people. We have to take back our country.
Donald Trump: (52:50)
We are descended from the heroes and patriots, the pioneers, the legends who tamed the great wilderness, who settled a vast continent, who worked the fields, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world. We are not going to let it be taken away from us.
Donald Trump: (53:21)
Our ancestors summoned the courage to fight and win our independence against the most powerful empire on earth. Our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents stormed the beaches to crush fascism. They found the strength to topple communism, and we will not be afraid of woke lunatics, who despise everything those heroes fought so hard for and those heroes fought and died for. There is no mountain we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. There is no challenge we cannot meet. As long as we remember that we are Americans and there is nothing that Americans cannot do.
Donald Trump: (54:14)
We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never ever surrender. My fellow Americans, our movement has just begun. In fact, our fight has only just begun. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country, perhaps the greatest movement in any country. We are going to make sure that we see it to the end. Our country will be stronger than ever before because the fact is we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. With love of our nation swelling in our hearts and the spirit of America staring in our souls, I say these words to you tonight. We will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Donald Trump: (56:06)
God bless you, Georgia. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.

			Greg Gutfeld: (00:05)
All right. Why should I say a thing? Let’s just get to round two. I want to ask you a question about COVID because you had COVID and my wife, you met my wife, I don’t know, it was like six years ago in Mar-a-Lago. She’s still not gotten vaccinated. And I keep talking to her to get her to get vaccinated and if she hasn’t, what would you say to her?
Donald Trump: (00:26)
Well, first of all, I say, why is she not doing it? Does she have some kind of religious thing?
Greg Gutfeld: (00:30)
Skeptical.
Donald Trump: (00:30)
Skeptical.
Greg Gutfeld: (00:31)
She’s skeptical. Doesn’t trust.
Donald Trump: (00:32)
Well, she’s Russian.
Greg Gutfeld: (00:33)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (00:33)
That’s the end of that.
Greg Gutfeld: (00:35)
Exactly. You can’t argue with a Russian.
Donald Trump: (00:38)
No. Very smart and very hard-headed. I think I know your wife a little bit, right?
Greg Gutfeld: (00:44)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (00:44)
But she’s great. And let her do what she wants to do. I got vaccinated and I feel very good. I think we saved millions and millions of people worldwide. In 1917 they say approximately a hundred million people died. I think we could have been into that situation because it was very bad. And now if you’re vaccinated, the other thing that shows that if you do get sick, you don’t get sick like they were before, meaning you don’t die.
Greg Gutfeld: (01:12)
Exactly.
Donald Trump: (01:12)
So I would recommend, but I also say that, let her have her freedom. [inaudible 00:01:18] freedom, right?
Greg Gutfeld: (01:18)
Yeah, exactly.
Donald Trump: (01:19)
She needs freedom.
Greg Gutfeld: (01:21)
She needs a lot of freedom from me, I found.
Donald Trump: (01:25)
I probably have to agree with that.
Greg Gutfeld: (01:26)
Oh, here’s a question. I bet no one’s ever asked you this. I think I might know the answer. How hard is it being president from a scale to one to 10?
Donald Trump: (01:37)
Well, I had two forms of presidency. Number one, I had to run the country, work on the world and do things, and the other thing I had to survive. The survival was much tougher because I had fake Mueller people coming after me. I had 19 really haters after me. I had every form of law enforcement after me. It started from the day I came down the escalator. It never stops. I have every prosecutor after me. They’re looking at deals that I did years and years ago, I forgot about them. It is a disgrace. So I had to survive, number one. And number two, really, I guess I’d put it in a different order, but if you don’t survive, you can’t do a good job in terms of running. So I had survival and I had running the country.
Donald Trump: (02:21)
And I would say the survival was actually much tougher. Somebody said, “What was the toughest, president?” A friend of mine. Very successful guy, used to call me Don, Donny, Donald. Now he said … You lose all your friends because you’re president. They’re all afraid to talk to you. “Mr. President, could I ask you one question? Who was the toughest to deal with it? Was it China? Could it be Putin in Russia? What about North Korea? Kim Jong-un?” I said, “Well, the toughest actually was the United States. Dealing with these maniacs that we have over here with Pelosi and Schumer and all of them. That was probably the toughest. Far tougher than a lot of world leaders.” And isn’t that a shame when you think about it? Isn’t it a shame?
Greg Gutfeld: (03:06)
Well, there was an irrational response to you and I lost friends when I would defend you.
Donald Trump: (03:14)
But you also gained friends.
Greg Gutfeld: (03:15)
Yeah. You gain friends. I didn’t listen to by family members who were voting for you during the time. And I had friends who were voting for you, but I didn’t listen. And then when I turned and started listening, then I lost all of my other friends. Did it bother you to see friends that you’ve had lose these friends because you became president and they didn’t like what you were doing, or they became emotionally irrationally kind of unhinged? Trump delusion.
Donald Trump: (03:45)
Sure. Right. Trump-
Greg Gutfeld: (03:47)
Derangement syndrome.
Donald Trump: (03:48)
They call them a lot of things, but derangement syndrome seems … and there is something like that. It’s crazy. And why would they do that? We rebuilt the military. We took care of everything. We came up, whether you say vaccines are helping people medically, right to try, where they were able to try somebody dying. And we have drugs that might work and you couldn’t use them.
Greg Gutfeld: (04:08)
None of that mattered because it was an emotional response.
Donald Trump: (04:11)
Taxes, by the way. Regulations, the largest tax cut in history, largest regulation cut by far in history, in all records.
Greg Gutfeld: (04:19)
Why did people respond emotionally to you rather than rationally?
Donald Trump: (04:24)
It must be my personality. We did a great job. I rebuilt the military, all that beautiful stuff, that brand new stuff and you know who has it now? The Taliban.
Greg Gutfeld: (04:34)
The Taliban.
Donald Trump: (04:36)
I built it for the Taliban.
Greg Gutfeld: (04:37)
Exactly.
Donald Trump: (04:37)
It wasn’t supposed to happen. Now we see these beautiful, perfect brand new rifles, and these guys are carrying two. And they’re wearing our uniforms and they’re flying our helicopters, and it’s a disgrace.
Greg Gutfeld: (04:50)
You know what? We might have converted them because it’s like Christmas to them.
Donald Trump: (04:54)
Well, it is Christmas.
Greg Gutfeld: (04:55)
It is Christmas.
Donald Trump: (04:56)
They’re still celebrating. Okay. So I told you about Abdul, funny stuff. And when I first spoke to him by phone, I said, “Nice to speak to you by phone, Abdul.” And he goes, “Ah.” They’re ferocious people. You go to Broadway shows, they fight. They like to fight. They’ve been fighting for about a thousand years. How we-
Greg Gutfeld: (05:15)
I hate Broadway.
Donald Trump: (05:16)
By the way I say … You do? I like it actually. It’s very interesting, and I’ve been saying it for a long time. Our country, the worst decision ever made was going into the quicksand, which is called the Middle East. $2 trillion and millions of lives, because I like to count both sides, okay? Millions of lives and the place has been obliterated. And it’s more dangerous now, if you think about it. I had them in check. I wiped out ISIS, you know who I took out. I took out the leaders, the biggest people, bigger than anybody. Nobody even believes what I did. And in a few months, it can all be dissipated.

			Donald Trump: (00:00)
As one nation, America mourns the loss of our brave and brilliant American service members in a savage and barbaric terrorist attack in Afghanistan. These noble American warriors laid down their lives in the line of duty. They sacrifice themselves so the country that they loved, racing against time to rescue their fellow citizens from harm’s way. They died as American heroes and our nation will honor their memory forever. I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of those we have lost. Today all Americans grieve alongside you. Together we also pray that God will heal the other courageous American service members who were wounded in this heinous attack. In addition, our hearts are with the families of all the innocent civilians who died, and with the many men, women, and children who were terribly injured in this act of evil.
Donald Trump: (01:00)
This tragedy should never have taken place, it should never have happened, and it would not have happened if I were your president. Over the past few weeks I know that many Americans have felt profound sorrow and even pain watching the events taking place in Afghanistan, and perhaps none more so than the veterans of that 20 year war. Many of them answered the call proudly and without hesitation after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. Every American who served in Afghanistan has made tremendous sacrifices for our country. On behalf of your fellow citizens, I want you to know that those sacrifices were not made in vain. We know what you did, we know how brave you were, and we thank you, we salute you, and we honor you for all time. I hope that every American will join me in continuing to pray for the safe return of all US citizens and soldiers from Afghanistan in the coming days. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

			Donald Trump: (08:53)
Thank you. Thank you. Wow, this is a big crowd. I’ll tell you. This goes all the way back. I wish they’d show it because they just don’t do that. They don’t like… This goes all the way back. I just looked at it on television, but it’s our television. We show it, but they don’t show it. You know why? Because they’re fake news. Right? They’re fake news. Hello, Alabama. And I’m thrilled to be back in your incredible, wonderful state that we won by a record number. We won this state. We also won a lot of other states by numbers that they don’t tell you about. We did have a rigged election. Didn’t we. It was terrible, terrible. And you look at what’s going on now. You look at what’s going on now and the border, but take a look at Afghanistan, what’s happening.
Donald Trump: (09:47)
But I’m with thousands of proud, hardworking, incredible American patriots. With your help, we’re going to elect our friend, Mo Brooks, to the U.S. Senate. We’re going to fire Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, and the radical left. And we’re going to make America great again. We have been making it so great. Now they’re biting into that, but we’re not going to let that happen. We can never let that happen. That’s why I had the idea… All my ideas… Someday, they’re going to tell me how to do things. But I liked the George Patton piece. Did you like that, General Patton? I thought so. Because we’re getting a little tired of the woke generals that we have. Right? Where they move our military out before they move our civilians. And before they move $83 billion worth of equipment. Let’s move them out. And the Taliban looks and they say, “I can’t believe it. This could only happen to us. I can’t believe it. The military left.” They go in. We have 45,000 people there, Americans, anywhere from, I guess, 15. They have no idea how many. That’s even worse. They say, “It could be 10. Oh, it could also be 45,000.” But it’s a lot of people and equipment like nobody has anywhere in the world 83 billion dollars.
Donald Trump: (11:12)
One year ago this month, in my nomination acceptance speech, which you remember. A lot of you were there. I see a lot of you that were there. I warned the entire country of the disastrous consequences of a Biden presidency. I understood it. A lot of you understood it too. I said that Joe Biden would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a pandemic. He did. I predicted that he would unleash a wave of violent crime that would turn our cities into a nightmare of killing and bloodshed. You look at these Democrat run cities, Chicago, L.A., big cities, small cities, everyone run by a Democrat, New York. They don’t prosecute people in New York, only Republicans they prosecute. They don’t prosecute murderers and killers. They prosecute Republicans. It’s misconduct. It’s called prosecutorial misconduct. But I told you this was going to be happening. We stated it loud and clear.
Donald Trump: (12:14)
We said he would impose crippling shutdowns and restrictions on in-person schooling and that these painful policies would nonetheless fail to stop the virus. He didn’t stop the virus. They say, “Oh, he gets wonderful marks.” He doesn’t get good marks. He’s done a terrible job, including on vaccinations, including on everything else. And now the virus is back. The virus is back. I’m shaking hands with everybody backstage. I say, “Well, I don’t know. Is this a good thing or bad?” You’ll read about it in three or four days maybe, hopefully not.
Donald Trump: (12:51)
But I said that Biden would embolden America’s enemies. And that’s what he’s done. And that the radical Democrat socialist agenda would set our nation on the road to economic ruin. You look at what’s going on with inflation. Has anyone noticed that your gasoline is now at levels that you never thought you’d see again, six months ago? So we had $1.87 a gallon and we had a thriving industry, energy independent. Nobody thought we’d ever be energy independent. We didn’t need the Middle East. We didn’t need them. And now you have over five dollars in many cases and it’s going, even here, it’s going to be over five very soon.
Donald Trump: (13:39)
And I saw the other day before this whole thing with Afghanistan started… Because right now nobody’s talking even about energy, even about the horrible border condition that they’re allowing millions of people to come into our country. People that we have no idea, but people aren’t talking about that. They’re talking about the disaster of Afghanistan.
Donald Trump: (13:59)
Not only have my predictions come 100% true, but it’s even worse than any of us could have imagined in our worst nightmare. Nobody thought this kind of thing could happen. Biden has obliterated our border, given up our energy independence, caused soaring inflation. He failed totally on economic and policies. I mean, you look at what’s going on. It’s crazy. And the senators that voted for this 1.2 trillion dollar bill of which they call it infrastructure, but only 11% is infrastructure. Where the hell are these people coming from? It’s the roadmap. They call it the glide path.
Donald Trump: (14:43)
It’s the roadmap to the Green New Deal, conceived and dedicated by A.O.C., a real beauty. She’s a real beauty. She knows more about the environment. I don’t think she ever even took… Did she ever take a course? She wasn’t a good student. Did she ever take a course on the environment? Remember, remember when at first she said you have 12 years to live. She said that two years ago. It means you have, right now you’re about nine and a half years. Somehow, you’re not worried about that, but you are worried about China and Russia and other places. Okay.
Donald Trump: (15:19)
We rebuilt our military stronger, bigger, better than ever before. And now I see it being dissipated and being given… Our military is being given to the enemy.
Donald Trump: (15:35)
Biden failed totally on the pandemic. And he’s now overseeing the greatest foreign policy humiliation in the history of the United States of America. This is the greatest humiliation I’ve ever seen. Biden’s botched exit in Afghanistan is the most astonishing display of gross incompetence by a nation’s leader, perhaps at any time that anybody’s ever seen. Name another situation like this. Vietnam looks like a master class in strategy compared to Joe Biden’s catastrophe.
Donald Trump: (16:11)
And it didn’t have to happen. All he had to do is leave the soldiers there until everything’s out our citizens, our weapons, then you bomb the hell out of the bases. We have five bases. And you say, “Bye, bye.” You say, “Bye, bye.” The scene of those big giant planes, taking off with people hanging on the sides and falling off, there’ll never be anything like that. That’s worse than the helicopters. You remember the helicopters taking off the roofs. This blows it away. Not even a contest. This will go down as one of the great military defeats of all time. And it did not have to happen that way. This is not a withdrawal. This was a total surrender. It was a surrender for no reason. They weren’t asking. We had them. I dealt with Abdul. He was the leader. I said, “Abdul, anything happens, we are going to reign terror upon you. It will be a terrible thing. Don’t touch our American citizens. Don’t ever come to our country. Don’t ever come to our country. And you’re going to continue fighting your civil war.” I can’t do that. They’ve been fighting it for hundreds of years. That’s what they do is they fight and they’re good fighters. But I had a good relationship other than that one statement. After I said that, I said, “Now let’s get down to business.” And we had a conditions-based agreement. And they didn’t meet the first two conditions and we hit them hard. And then they met them. And then they had a couple of other conditions that they were ready to meet. And then we had a rigged election and we had a new President. And the new President came into office, and he dropped to his knees and he said, “Come on in and take everything that we have.” This is a disgraceful thing. The most embarrassing thing that we’ve ever seen in this country. There’s never been an embarrassment. And the nations of the world, both friend and foe are looking at us and saying, “What the hell happened so quickly to the United States of America? They can’t believe it.
Donald Trump: (18:28)
The equipment that they’ve got is the most sophisticated military equipment in the world. He surrendered our air base. He surrendered our weapons. He surrendered our embassy. They spent a billion dollars building this ridiculous embassy. And he abandoned our great American citizens. They’re over right now. They have no idea. Remember this, the Taliban’s tough and they don’t respect our country and they don’t respect our President. It’s not good. They’re over there now. And they don’t know what’s going to happen, our citizens. Joe Biden was going on vacation as Afghanistan was going to hell.
Donald Trump: (19:12)
And this is what you get when you have weakness in the White House. You can’t have weakness in the White House. They have to respect your President. When I was President, we only had strength. Remember the 59 shots we took at Syria? 59 missiles, every single one of them hit their target from 700 miles away. And I was sitting with President Xi of China, you remember? Having chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago. It was wonderful cake. And when I said to him, what we had just done, the missiles were launched, he looked at me and he goes, “Repeat.” I didn’t know. He spoke English actually. He said, “Repeat.” I said, “What did you just say, repeat?” So he spoke a little more English than I thought, because he never said hello. But he said, “Repeat.”
Donald Trump: (20:04)
And I said, “We just shot 59 missiles in from ships very far away. Every one of them hit their target. It was an incredible display of talent and weapons.” And the reason we did that is because we had to. Because President Obama and Biden drew the red line in the sand and said, “Don’t cross it.” And they crossed it. And nothing happened. That’s when Russia got involved. Russia went in. They said, “Oh, nothing’s going to happen.” So Russia got involved. Other countries got involved. That red line in the sand from President Obama, that was just absolutely, it just didn’t matter. It was just words. That’s the problem with a lot of politicians actually, but not Mo. But it just doesn’t matter. When he said, “Red line don’t ever cross it,” and they crossed it and nothing happened.
Donald Trump: (20:58)
But the 59 missiles were an incredible display under my administration. Everyone in the world knew not to mess around with America. They knew that. They understood our power and that I would not hesitate to use it in defense of our citizens. And the Taliban understood that maybe as well as anybody. This would never have happened if I was President. Our country was so respected. Everybody respected our country. China respected our country. We took in billions and billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs from China. They never gave us 25 cents. But then of course the China virus came and it was a lot different. My attitude toward China changed. As I personally told the Taliban leader, if anyone ever double crossed the United States of America, it would be the last thing they ever did. We said it loud and clear. And you knew it better than anybody in Alabama knew it. Because one thing, we won Alabama by a record. We won South Carolina by a record. And then they said we lost Georgia. How the hell did that happen? That doesn’t happen. No, we know how that happened. We know how it happened.
Donald Trump: (22:29)
But under our leadership, America was respected again. Our people did a great job. I’ve been watching Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State. He did a great job and he’s going around spreading the word. And General Kellogg and others have been great. But they understood this would never, could never happen. It could never happen. You never move the military first. You move the military last. We had total control militarily. They would have never come in. We could have kept them there for a long time, but 21 years, we want to bring them home. But we want to bring them home with dignity. Very soon we’re going to have September 11th and you’re going to have, because of Biden, the Taliban flag flying over our embassy, flying over our facilities. So that was not even a possibility that a thing like that could happen.
Donald Trump: (23:25)
We decimated ISIS. You remember that. ISIS, we had a great, great success. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And in a short period of time, we killed its leader and founder Al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the senior ranks of Al-Qaeda and we terminated the world’s top terrorist in Soleimani, who killed a lot of American soldiers and a lot of other people too. And they knew we weren’t playing games. They understood that right from the beginning. This proven record of America’s strength laid the groundwork to safely and responsibly bring our trips back home. Nobody was going to mess with us. And then this clown, they rigged the whole damn deal and he got in office. And now, now they’re taking advantage of us. And remember this, this isn’t stopping. This is going to go on for a long time. This is going to go on for a long time. This isn’t going away. This isn’t like a three-day hit. It’s going to go on for a long time.
Donald Trump: (24:35)
Taliban, great negotiators, tough fighters, great negotiators, they’ve got 45,000 people. You’ve got a lot of people also that deserve to be helped and they’re not going to let them be helped at all. This is going to go on for a long time. This is a great stain on the reputation of our country. Going into the Middle East was one of the most disastrous decisions that our country has ever been involved with. We’ve never had a decision. In my opinion, it was the…
Donald Trump: (25:03)
… been involved with. We’ve never had a decision, in my opinion, it was the worst decision that we’ve ever had. It was quicksand, quicksand. We should’ve gone in, knocked the hell out of it. I met a general, his name was general [inaudible 00:25:16]. I don’t even know, maybe he’s not even on my side, who the hell knows with these generals. When I get through with this guy Milley, I mean, how about Milley?
Donald Trump: (25:24)
Remember, remember? Remember, when I walked to the church, proudly walked to the church that the protesters, they tried to burn it down, but I walked to the church, protestors out there and Milley was walking with me. And the next day, the radical left media starts calling, “You shouldn’t have walked. You shouldn’t have walked.” Instead of saying, “I’m proud to walk with my President,” and not because it’s me because of the office. Instead of saying that, he wanted to apologize for walking with the President of the United States.
Donald Trump: (25:58)
And I said, ” This guy doesn’t have what it takes.” And you’re seeing that now, because the worst decisions I’ve ever seen… That’s again, why I put the Patton, I just remembered it as I was coming over here. I said, “Get that clip quickly. The people of Alabama understand that clip.” Do you think that… Let me ask you, do you think that General Patton was woke? I don’t think so. What do you think Mike? Mike, was he woke? I don’t think so.
Speaker 5: (26:33)
We love you Trump.
Donald Trump: (26:34)
I don’t think he was too woke. He was the exact opposite. You know what woke means? It means you’re a loser. Everything woke, everything woke… It’s true. Everything woke turns to shit, okay. It’s true, it’s true. Look at what’s happening.
Speaker 6: (27:04)
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
Donald Trump: (27:26)
I got a little trouble. I said that our women’s soccer team was supposed to easily win, but they went woke except for a few of them. I love those women that stood up and they saluted our flag, there were some of them. But the one with the purple hair, she didn’t play too well. She went, well, you can have her. And they didn’t do too well, unfortunately. We want them to do well, but they didn’t. But it’s true about woke. You just take a look, everything goes bad. It’s really, it’s a shortcut to losing everything you have. They want to get rid of our great heroes and heroines. They want to get rid of our history, our culture. We’re not going to do it.
Donald Trump: (28:12)
We’re not going to do it. When they were starting to rip down our statues and it started with people, confederate people, generals, some respected, some not, but they’re taking down our culture and our heritage. And then it started with others. And then it went to Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee was part of our history and then it went to Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson. Now, George Washington. In San Francisco they’re taken the name of George Washington off schools. Can you believe it? We’re not going to let this stuff go on. The hardest thing I had to do as president was signing letters to the families of soldiers who were killed in the Middle East. Often I called the parents, very often. Sometimes I went to Dover Air Force Base. That’s where the bodies of the soldiers would come in and I’d see them bringing a young man, young woman in a coffin.
Donald Trump: (29:13)
And I’d be with the parents. And I’ve told this story a couple of times. The parents would sometimes be unbelievable, you would almost not understand. It was like, “Sir, it’s so great to meet you.” And they’d always tell stories about their child. “So my son could throw a football so long. He was a quarterback in high school. He was a quarterback in college. Sir, I think he could have been in the NFL. He was really good. He was so great.” And we’re waiting for the plane to come in. And sometimes they’d be talking about their daughter. Lots of daughters were killed, coming out of the Middle East. “My daughter was so beautiful, Sir. She was so incredible. She was the greatest.” And I’d say to the general and the colonel that ran Dover, the great people… We have great, by the way, we have great generals. We have great generals. The ones you see on television are not the ones that are great.
Donald Trump: (30:07)
We have great generals and we have great leaders and a great military that I rebuilt. I rebuilt it. It was exhausted. But I’d say to the general and the colonel that ran Dover and they saw the bodies coming in many days of the week, I’d say, “General, it’s amazing. The parents seem so fine. They can handle it.” “No, they can’t, Sir.” I said, “No, I just spent a half an hour talking to them. They were okay. I mean, they understand what happened. They’re okay.” “No, they’re not, Sir. When that plane pulls up, Sir, that big unbelievable, powerful,” just like you saw three days ago with the bodies dropping off the sides. How desperate are people to leave when you’re hanging, clinging to a plane that goes up thousands of feet and you eventually have to let go, how desperate is that?
Donald Trump: (31:06)
How sad and how desperate. But when that cargo plane pulled up and that door opened, the general said, “Sir, when that door opens and you had the most beautiful young people carrying a coffin or a number of coffins off of the plane. Sir, when that happens, you’ll see, the parents are not okay.” So I was talking to people that seemed to be fine. I was amazed at their strength. And 10 minutes later, I watched that same mother and that same father screaming, screaming, running to the coffin, as it was being taken off, breaking security lines, you couldn’t stop them. I’ve never seen anything like it. And for what? And for what? And then you have a man who just retreats and gives up and it’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace to our country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace to everybody.
Donald Trump: (32:10)
The most incredible people, but that was the saddest thing, seeing that Dover, you go to Dover. You go also to Walter Reed Medical Center, incredible doctors. I will tell you this, most incredible doctors. And you see the horrific injuries and you see the parents, the wife, the husband standing and looking over the body of somebody that was just absolutely shattered. In some cases, no legs. In one case, I’ll never forget, no legs, no arm. And then the other arm half and said to me, “Sir, I got lucky. I was able to save a half an arm.” And I’m looking and I’m saying, “We can never let this happen again. It was a terrible, terrible thing that happened. It was such a horrific mistake.” But these people represent our nation. They’re the greatest people our nation has ever had. Ever had.
Donald Trump: (33:34)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So we had a deal where we were going to get out with great honor, and they weren’t going to play games. And we had them melded in with the government, but I’ve never been a big fan of Ghani. I always said he was a total crook. I’ve said it for years. It turned out he was a crook. He was a crook. And he left. He fled. He fled with a lot of cash. What we’ve done, how we got into that mess, it’s just amazing. But we could have gotten out with honor and we should have gotten out with honor. And instead we got out with the exact opposite of honor. Since my administration began negotiating a peace deal last year, somebody said, “Oh, he’s dealing with the Taliban.” Who the hell else am I supposed to deal with?
Donald Trump: (34:24)
Deal with the people that ran or the people that were highly paid, we paid the soldiers. They were among the highest paid soldiers of the world. I remember a certain, highly overrated general came to my office, “Sir, they’re fighting for their lives. They’re fighting For their country.” I said, “No, general, they’re paid more than any soldier in the world. And when that payment stops, they’re gone.” And that’s exactly what happened. Exactly what happened. But since my administration began the negotiations on the peace deal last year, not a single American service member has been killed in combat in Afghanistan. It’s over 18 months now, 18 months.
Donald Trump: (35:05)
And you know why that is? Not because the Taliban aren’t great fighters because they are great fighters. All you have to do is ask Russia, which used to be called the Soviet Union. And because of Afghanistan, it’s now Russia, much smaller version of what it was because of Afghanistan. They went bust, spending so many years and so much money and not winning in Afghanistan, but all of that money they spent, all of the lives they lost, same thing. But all you have to do is ask Russia, “What do you think?” Now I hear they going back in, not so fast. Everybody that’s gone in, hasn’t been so good. And you know what, we have to go in and we should go in when it’s right. And we now may have to be forced to go in because this person that is running our country made a horrific decision of taking all of our powerful military out.
Donald Trump: (36:07)
We may be forced to go in. And we may not be forced, but we may be forced to go in. And if you’re not prepared to go in, you’re never going to see those 45,000 people again. That I can tell you. If they don’t think you’re prepared to go in, you’re never going to see again, whether it’s 10 or 45,000 people, you’ll never see them again. All Joe Biden had to do was follow our plan. It’s like the border, all he had to do is go to the beach. He didn’t have to do anything. We had the tightest, most secure border. We built almost 500 miles of wall. He could have finished it in one month. Instead, he’s paying billions of dollars not to finish it. And I would have had it much earlier, but I got sued by the Democrats and Congress so much, took two and a half years for me to win the lawsuits. After we won all the lawsuits, we built it at a rapid pace. It was just about finished, helped us great. We set records, records at the border. All he had to do was go to the beach. Same thing here. All he had to do is follow our plan. That was conditional, so if they don’t follow it, then we start blasting them again. They didn’t want to be blasted. They were tired of being blasted. They were tired. They’re tough. Everybody’s tough. But you know what? We’re tougher, he just said it. But nobody would know it. Nobody would know it. When you look at what’s happening, nobody would know it. But we’re tougher, I’d like to explain that to Abdul and to everybody else.
Donald Trump: (37:37)
We’re much tougher. Please remember that. It’s hard for them to understand that now after watching this. Think of that, the soldiers have left. I could just see this, the leadership of the Taliban standing there, somebody walking up, “Sir, the soldiers have left Afghanistan.” He goes, “What?” “The soldiers have left.” And they’ve left all of their citizens behind and they’ve left $83 billion worth of equipment behind, including brand new Apache helicopters, thousands of Humvee vehicles with armor guard, equipment that nobody has ever even seen before, it was so sophisticated and good. So can you imagine these guys Abdul and his friends sitting there, that the United States soldiers, our military, has left.
Donald Trump: (38:33)
They walked in, they walked in and they took everything. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. I’ve never seen anything so stupid in my life. Somebody said, “Don’t say it, Sir. It’s not good.” I asked yesterday, I was with a group of people and there was a five year old child. And I explained the situation to the five year old child. They said, ” No, you shouldn’t do that, Sir, because the press won’t like it.” I said, “That’s okay. I don’t mind. The press doesn’t like anything I do.” They actually do like it, but they’ll never say it, okay. But I asked the child, “So what would you do,” after describing, “Would you leave the military until everything’s out, including the civilians and all of that incredible military equipment? Or would you have the military go out first?”
Donald Trump: (39:31)
“Sir, I’d leave the military in.” He was five. He said, “I’d leave the military in, get everything out first.” I said, “Thank you very much.” But they didn’t want me to tell that story. They thought it was not an appropriate story, but it’s true. This is a five year old kid, five or six year old kid. And this is what we’re stuck with. But when Biden took office, he foolishly tore up our really good plan. Again, not a plan, it’s conditions. We do this, we do this, we do this. If you don’t do these things, we’re not going to do it. And then we start dropping bombs all over the place and they say, “You know what? We’re going to do it. We’ve decided to do it.” No, we had a good understanding.
Donald Trump: (40:19)
They always hate it. Remember when I came in, Obama said, “The worst problem we have is North Korea, Kim Jong-un.” I said, “What’s the problem?” He said, “I think you’re going to go to war with North Korea.” I said, “Have you ever called him?” “No.” Actually, he called him 14 times and was not responded to, but he told me, “No,” but that wasn’t truthful. I said, “Would be good to talk to him, wouldn’t it, rather than nuclear war, wouldn’t it be nice?” Anyway, through a series of events, I did talk to him and it was nasty at the beginning, remember? He said, “We have a red button on my desk.” And I said, “I have a much bigger red button. And my red button works and yours doesn’t.” And anyway, it was very nasty. And then all of a sudden, it became a love fest. It became great, right?
Donald Trump: (41:08)
And I went to North Korea, went to South Korea, went across the line. We got along great. There was no nuclear catastrophe, but you got to be careful because he does not respect Joe Biden. And he does not respect any longer America. But I said, it’s good to speak to people. I stopped the pipeline in Russia. I stopped it. Nobody’s ever been tougher to Russia, but I got along great with President Putin. We had a great relationship. He said, “You’re killing me with this pipeline.” I said, “Look, not right, Germany shouldn’t have been doing that.” The European union takes tremendous advantage of us almost as bad economically as China.
Donald Trump: (41:49)
People say, “Oh, that’s a terrible thing to say.” I say, “Really, how many Chevrolets are in Beijing right now? Maybe none.” Okay. They won’t take our cars. They won’t take our farm products. They won’t take anything. And I was hitting them hard. And then the China virus came and it was a terrible period of time. But we did the greatest job. And because the base was so strong, what we did was so strong, our country is doing well. It’s going to be blown now with all the inflation and everything else that’s taking place. But we built such a strong foundation that our country is doing great. And other countries are doing horribly, horribly. Remember they used to use anything to hit us. When we got hit, I closed it to China, closed it to Europe, anything to hit us. But they’d say, “In South Korea, they’re doing so well.” South Korea is being decimated right now. “India is doing so well.” India is being decimated right now. We did a great job on that. The ventilators, the equipment that we got, the cupboards were all bare.
Donald Trump: (42:50)
Everything that we did, and then we developed a vaccine, three vaccines in three months, in nine months. And actually, I’ll tell you, it was three days less, three days less than nine months. And it’s great. And you know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. But you got to do what you have to do, but I recommend, take the vaccines. I did it. It’s good. Take the vaccines, but you got… No, that’s okay. That’s all right. You got your freedoms. But I happened to take the vaccine. If it doesn’t work, you’ll be the first to know, okay. I’ll call up Alabama and say, “Hey, you know what?” But it is working. But you do have your freedoms. You have to keep, you have to maintain that. You have to maintain that. And you got to get your kids back to school. And the mask issue is interesting because Fauci said, “Masks are bad,” and now he’s a radical masker.
Donald Trump: (43:47)
Now he wants you to wear 15 different masks at one time. I don’t know. He also told me he was a great athlete. Then I saw him throw out a pitch at the baseball game. “I used to be a great athlete, Sir.” “You did, really? Oh, that’s good.” Then I watch him on television. That’s not [inaudible 00:44:04]. The ball almost went to first base, didn’t it? The issue here is not about whether to leave Afghanistan. The issue is Joe Biden’s staggering incompetence and gross negligence. He doesn’t know where the hell he is. You think, he’s running the government? He’s not running the government. Creating the greatest strategic humiliation that we’ve ever seen as a country. And it was something that we should’ve stopped and the general should have done something. They should have done something.
Donald Trump: (44:37)
They should have talked to him and said, “Look, Commander in Chief,” but you just couldn’t have done that. If he had that evacuate… If he just moved the people out, he should have done it and he should have done it first. He had to have done it first. Sometimes in life decisions are made and when those decisions are made, if they’re bad decisions, you’ve got to get away from them and you’ve got to get away from them fast. And if you don’t get away from them, you’re not going to have a country anymore. I said about elections, if we don’t have great elections, if we don’t have borders, if we don’t have the things that are being taken away from us, we’re not going to have a country anymore. And certainly, we’re not going to have a respected country anymore.
Donald Trump: (45:22)
With me in office, the Taliban would not have ever dreamt of capturing our airfield or parading around with our American weapons. Did you see all those guns they have? Who recognized those guns, because they’re same guns you had. We made them. There would have been no emergency embassy evacuation and no taking down of our flag. They took down our flag. Because we would have established clear lines that the Taliban would have never dared to cross. The problem with Biden is that our enemies are not afraid of him. They don’t respect him, our adversaries and our allies no longer trust him. They can’t trust him any longer. Remember he went back and he went to Europe and they didn’t know what the hell was going on. And they said, “What the heck.” We’re back. In other words, we’re back. Now you can continue to take advantage of us because Europe took advantage of us with NATO like nobody ever. I got Europe to pay $430 billion toward NATO. They would have never paid. For 15, 18 years, it was like this, the payment.
Donald Trump: (46:35)
And we’re protecting them. And some of them were totally delinquent. They didn’t pay. And I said, “You got to pay.” They said, “Sir, what would happen if we didn’t pay? Would you protect us?” I said, “If you didn’t pay, I would not recommend protecting you.” And it was amazing how fast that money came in, right? That money came in fast, 430. Started off with 130 billion. Billion, not million, billion. And then 430 billion came in very quickly. “We did a lot of good things with South Korea.” I said, “We protect you for nothing. You’ve got to pay. You’re a rich country. You make the boats, you make all of our television sets, which you took from us. Thank you very much. You make so many cars for us. You got to pay.” And they agreed. And they paid billions of dollars at my request. It wasn’t that easy. It took a little while, about two days. They agreed to pay billions of dollars, billions of dollars. And then I said, “Look, next year, wait till after the election. But you’re going to have to pay at least $5 billion.”
Donald Trump: (47:39)
“No, no, no. We will not pay.” I said, “Yes, you will pay. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.” He said, “No, no, no. President Moon, nice man, good man.” But he said, “No,” which he should say. Why should he, when he was suckering us for so many years. So he said, “No, no.” I said, “You’re going to have to pay five billion.” But then the election result turned out different than what it should have, different from the real result. And I just heard, they made a deal with South Korea to pay a cost of living adjustment. You know what that is? Nothing. When the money I raised, it’s like nothing. And that’s, so they were, that was another country, I’m sure, that was extremely happy with the results. But I did a great job in protecting them. I think I’ve saved them from Kim Jong-un. So I don’t think they… I tell you what, a lot of people from South Korea come up to me and say, “Thank you very much, Sir.” I really, I think I saved them from Kim Jong-un because of the relationship I developed with Kim Jong-un.
Donald Trump: (48:41)
Biden is the most pathetic president. And look, he makes Jimmy Carter look great, right? Look at that man with that jacket. I love you, man. How many rallies have you come to? What number is this?
Speaker 7: (48:55)
30.
Donald Trump: (48:56)
Much more than that. He’s all… Much more. We have some women. Are they here tonight? North Carolina. Where are they? Where are they? We have some women, they’ve been to 96. I didn’t even know we did 96. I said, “How many?” “Sir, we’re up to about 96. I said, “I didn’t know we did that many.” But, look, this is a very unpleasant subject, but still, is this the greatest place to be in the world? And it’s [inaudible 00:49:25], right? It’s unpleasant to talk about it, but sometimes you have to think and talk about unpleasant things, but not only is it Biden and the embarrassment to the United States abroad. His radicalism and extremism is currently destroying our nation right here at home. And nobody understands that better than Alabama, nobody. Remember when Biden used to go and say he’s an Iowa and he’d say, “It’s great to be an Idaho.” Sir, you’re in Iowa.
Donald Trump: (50:03)
And he’d say, “It’s great to be an Idaho.” “Sir, you’re in Iowa.” He would do this all the time. He was in New Hampshire, “It’s great to be in Maine today.” “Sir, you’re in New Hampshire.” The worst was when he was in New York and he said it’s great to be in Florida. There were no palm trees. “Great to be in Florida,” he’d do it all the time. I’ve never done it yet. I’ve never done it, with all of them speeches I’ve made. I was just saying, because I said Alabama. But I know exactly, I didn’t have to think about it. It’s called Alabama. I love Alabama. I’ve always loved Alabama.
Donald Trump: (50:37)
And I’ve always said if that ever happens, you can forget about the rest of the night because the speech is a total disaster. In other words, “It’s great to be in South Carolina with you people tonight,” I’d say, if that ever happened it’s a disaster. You might as well just walk off the stage. Because you could be Winston Churchill, great speaker… You could be Winston Churchill, the great Winston Churchill, make an increment rest of the speech and it’s a disaster. The only difference is, if you make a speech, if he does it, which he does all the time in different forms, the press doesn’t cover it.
Donald Trump: (51:14)
He’s the only guy that didn’t get covered falling, walking up the stairs. The press didn’t cover it other than a couple internet covered it, I guess. Right? Do you think they would have covered it if I fell on the Air Force One? He fell three times. ” Down goes Frazier,” remember that? He kept going down and up, down and up. I said, “What the hell is going on here?” I was watching that. “Whats going on with our president?” And it wasn’t on one nightly news cast. I think I might’ve been on… I did the ramp, the long slippery ramp. I said, “General,” it was pouring out, pouring. I said, “General, this is a bad deal here. I got leather shoes on the bottom and I’m going to fall. I’m not going to let them…” So I walked down tiny little steps.
Donald Trump: (52:05)
“What’s wrong with the president?” The biggest story. I was so proud when I got down, I didn’t fall. I said, “General, I don’t want to grab you, but I may have to grab you.” Big, strong general, Commandant of West Point. You know I made my best speech at West Point that day. But then it was pouring, and when I went down the ramp and it was pure… Normally they have like some little grooves, nothing. It was like an ice skating rink. I think it was a trap. And I said, “General, this is not a good situation. That sucker looks slippery as hell. And I’m not going to allow them to tape me falling.” Remember Gerald Ford fell, that was not a good time. Some other bad things happened to presidents, not a good time. You can’t do that, you can’t let that happen. So what happened is they made that a big story. I was so proud of myself. I made my best speech and nobody talked about that speech. Someday, hopefully, they’ll go back and get the speech I made at the graduation of West Point two years ago.
Donald Trump: (53:00)
I’d love you to hear that speech. I called up the First Lady. I said, “First Lady, I just made a great speech.” She said, “You’re on television for the way you went down a ramp.” It’s all they talked about. But with him falling down the stairs, three times, he was down. No, he’s up! No he’s down again, Oh my God! No he’s up! He’s down again. He’s down for three times. You know, if that were a fight, they’d stop it. Right? If that were a fight.They would’ve stopped it, Mike. In a matter of mere months, Biden has thrown our southern border wide open. When I left office we handed the new administration the most secure border in US history and they turned it into the greatest border disaster in American history, probably anywhere in the world. You know, they’re emptying their prisons out into our country.
Donald Trump: (53:49)
And I’m not just talking about Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. I’m talking about Middle Eastern countries. Yemen, people are coming in from Yemen. Our country will really be in trouble. We’ll really be in trouble.
Donald Trump: (54:06)
Under my administration we ended the ridiculous catch and release. You catch somebody, you find out they’re a criminal and you release them immediately into our country. We ended asylum fraud. We deported record numbers of criminal aliens. We negotiated historic agreements with Mexico and Central America to stop illegal immigration. And we built all of that wall that I just talked about.
Donald Trump: (54:32)
But we had a Stay in Mexico policy. “You can’t come into our country, I’m sorry. Stay in Mexico.” Biden ended it. He ended it. But you know what happened? Yesterday we won in court and a very wise judge said we’re allowed to have Stay in Mexico. Thank you, judge. Thank you, judge. Thank you very much. They use to stay in the United States and then you’d never find them again. You’d stay, and some of these people are seriously tough criminals.
Donald Trump: (55:05)
I achieved a 90% reduction in illegal border crossings. Think of that 90%, it was going to go much higher. And brought illegal immigration to a virtual halt. It was the lowest levels ever recorded and you could come into our country, but you had to come in legally. Finally, we did it, but we had a win a lot of court cases. Many of those court cases started against us by Democrats in Congress.
Donald Trump: (55:29)
Under the Trump administration our message was clear, if you try to come here illegally you will be caught, you will be detained and you will be immediately sent back home where you belong.
Donald Trump: (55:44)
And when people heard that… And they hear it, they’re genius, it’s genius. When people heard that and then they saw the results, because there wasn’t games, it was happening. They never came. They stopped. Remembered at the beginning with the caravans, we ended the caravans. But now the caravans are back at a level that nobody’s ever seen. Bigger, stronger, more powerful. It’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (56:08)
Now the radical left Democrats have surrendered our sovereignty to the coyotes and drug cartels, child smugglers, human traffickers, and they usually traffic in women. Biden stopped wall construction, instituted nationwide catch and release, wanted it back, and invited the entire world to make a mad dash for the USA when he said, “Come. You’re welcome.”
Donald Trump: (56:35)
I don’t know if he knew? Do people think this is a good thing, what happened? They’re destroying our country. Last month alone, border patrol, who we love apprehended a mind boggling 210,000 illegal border crosses. You can multiply that times 6, 7, 8 or 9 of the people that come in without getting caught. They say, you can use numbers like that.
Donald Trump: (57:03)
Record numbers are getting away and historic numbers are coming from outside Mexico and Central America from every corner all over the world. A lot of them coming in from the Middle East. At this rate, millions of illegal aliens will cross our border just this year alone. Millions. Millions of people, many of these people are hardened criminals, murderers. Again, think of this. Just think of this statement… They are emptying their jails into the United States.
Donald Trump: (57:36)
Think of that. A lot of people don’t know what that means. They are the toughest, meanest jails. They’re emptying them into the United States. This massive overcrowding on our border is a super spreader disaster that will bring new variants into our nation. And honestly far worse than variants, far worse.
Donald Trump: (57:58)
MS-13 is being replenished to levels never seen before. I brought MS-13 through ICE and Border Patrol out, by the thousands. Thousands. We were going into towns in Long Island, and these were brave warriors like law enforcement is, we have so much respect. And they’d go right into what they call a “nest” of a lot of these gang members, and they’d start fighting.
Donald Trump: (58:26)
All these guys that I know, my friends in the first row, I know every one of them very well. Not one of them would do this job. And if they did, they’d be knocked out in about two seconds. They wouldn’t do it well. They wouldn’t want to do it. ICE is, these are brilliant, great, tough, strong, but more important than anything, patriotic people.
Donald Trump: (58:47)
They would go into these towns and they would get these hardened criminals that are loaded up with weapons and they would get them the hell out of our country. It’s amazing what they did for us. And now they’re being treated horribly by this administration. Joe Biden is functionally abandoned ICE, shut down interior enforcement and turned our nation into a giant sanctuary for dangerous criminals.
Donald Trump: (59:10)
We have criminals coming in this country, nobody knows how bad it’s going to be. Watch, that’s another Trump prediction. In the Republican Party we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
Donald Trump: (59:28)
Under my administration, we found the gang members, drug dealers, and various MS-13 killers and we kicked… I mean quickly, we knock them out so fast nobody could believe it. Thousands! Thousands a year. And we quickly deported them or we put them behind bars where they belong. Sometimes they were so evil, so vicious we didn’t want to take a chance on bringing them back to their countries.
Donald Trump: (59:55)
And their countries didn’t want them, you know. You know that story. I’ve told that story. When I came in, we’d catch these people in Border Patrol, ICE, I’d meet with the top people. They’re incredible people. They’d say, “Sir, they won’t take the people.” I said, “What do you mean they won’t take them?” “They don’t want them back. They don’t want the gang members back. They don’t want the killers back. They won’t take them back.”
Donald Trump: (01:00:17)
When we fly in with an airplane, they put planes on the runway so we can’t land, we have to come back. The buses, they stopped. “They won’t take them back, sir.” None of the three major countries that we’re talking about, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, “Whey won’t take them back, sir.”
Donald Trump: (01:00:34)
I say, “Really? Do we give them any money every year?” This is early on, so I learned exactly what it was, but early on. You know, hadn’t done it too long, right? “Do we give them any money?” “Yes, sir!” “How much?” About $500 million a year, that’s a lot of money, right?
Donald Trump: (01:00:51)
So I said, “Good. Stop payment immediately. No more money going to these countries. No more money going to these countries.” I immediately stopped all of this 500 million, little more than that, 500 million going to the three countries. And a day went by and I got a call from all three of the heads of those countries who I knew and know and respect. They’re smart. They’re very streetwise people. They’re very smart and very, very streetwise.
Donald Trump: (01:01:20)
“Mr. President, you stopped many millions of dollars from coming into Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. You stopped it from coming in, Mr. President, is there something we did wrong?”
Donald Trump: (01:01:33)
“Yes. You’re not taking back people that came into our country illegally. You will not take them back.” “Oh, there must be some understanding, sir. We would love to have them back.” I said, “Congratulations, we’ll be sending lots of planes your way.” And we did, we got them all back and we still didn’t make the payment. I delayed that sucker a long time. We still didn’t make the payment, we waited a long time, but they took them all back.
Donald Trump: (01:02:02)
And then the other day I heard that Biden wants to give those countries $4 billion because he thinks that they’re going to spend the money on economic development. No, it’s going to go economic development into their bank accounts in Switzerland, okay? That’s the economic development we’re talking about.
Donald Trump: (01:02:26)
They want to give them $4 billion. They’re working on the paperwork right now. The money is going to be stolen. It’s going to be given to the cartels. It’s going to be given to the traffickers. It’s going to be kept by politicians. See, we only have honest politicians in our country, right? Like Mo. That’s true.
Donald Trump: (01:02:49)
We understand. And we’ve understood very much in America First that immigration security is national security. And that’s why we instituted the travel ban. Remember the travel ban? I took such heat where I was able to get people that came into our country from very tough countries… Very, very tough countries. And I was able to stop them from coming to our country because we didn’t want to have our stores blown up. We didn’t want to have buildings set on fire and death and destruction.
Donald Trump: (01:03:21)
So, we lost it in the lower court. We lost it in the second court. And then we won at the United States Supreme Court. And to show you how dishonest the press is, recently they wrote about it. They said, “He lost in court!” And they were right, at the lower court, but then I lost again. But then I won.
Donald Trump: (01:03:39)
I said, “You didn’t say I won.” “Well, you did loose.” In other words, technically they’re right, I lost in court. But I won and we have a travel ban. And without that travel ban, you would have some really bad, bad people in here from places in the world that are evil. And it was a great thing.
Donald Trump: (01:03:55)
I took a lot of heat over that travel ban. People said, “That’s not nice.” They all like to call it a “Muslim ban.” It wasn’t a Muslim ban, it was a travel ban from a lot of different countries that are bad and they send bad people to us. And because of the travel ban, we didn’t have to accept that. So it was a great success, but they try and make it look like it wasn’t very nice.
Donald Trump: (01:04:15)
We dramatically reduced refugee admissions and kept radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Is that okay? I mean, is that okay? One of the first acts that Biden did after Mitch McConnell said, “We must get back to work. We have to get our country going. We have to approve him as the president.” Even though the evidence was staggering, you’ll see the evidence starting to come out. It’s already come out, far beyond what we need. By the way… Far, far, far beyond what we need.
Donald Trump: (01:04:48)
“We have to get back to our country and running our country,” Mitch McConnell. And the first thing that Biden did was sign 17 of the worst executive orders in the history of our country. And one of them Biden revoked that beautiful, wonderful travel ban and has surged refugee resettlement from the most dangerous countries in the world. The most dangerous terrorists in the world. They come into our country now with no problem, “Come on in. Love to have you.”
Donald Trump: (01:05:28)
This is a sick culture and our country is a disaster and it’s going to die before your very eyes if this craziness isn’t stopped in so many ways.
Donald Trump: (01:05:41)
The Afghanistan thing is so simple to understand because, when people watch that, people that weren’t even into watching political things on the news… But when people watch this, they understood it immediately about the military. Don’t take them out, leave it to last. Sort of like the captain of a ship. “Let’s jump off first before the passengers, I’m getting the hell out of here.” Right? That’s what it is. The captain is supposed to wait and watch and work.
Donald Trump: (01:06:13)
But we’re seeing what happens when you have dishonest and rigged elections. This is what happens. This is what you get. Our nation is being destroyed from within by people who have no right to destroy it. No right. They have no right to destroy it.
Donald Trump: (01:06:28)
As everyone here understands, the 2020 election, that presidential election which was such a great day. At 10:00 it was over. Pennsylvania, Trump is winning by a lot. Arizona, Trump is winning by a lot. We don’t even talk about Alabama, there was nothing they could do with this one. There was nothing.
Donald Trump: (01:06:51)
You’re going to see things happening, it’ll go down as the most corrupt election in American history. And almost probably in any history. The evidence of the fraud is monumental and more is coming out. Just recently, Wisconsin election officials admitted they removed more than 200,000 voters.
Donald Trump: (01:07:20)
By the way, that’s 10 times more than I need to win, 10 times more. 200,000 from the voter roles and they did it, unfortunately, why didn’t they move them before the election? They removed them after the election. Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate it. They removed these names after the election was over. Approximately 20 times more than we needed.
Donald Trump: (01:07:50)
Earlier this month, it was revealed that in Georgia ballots were rejected by machines and illegally altered by hand to remove marks for Trump and instead cast votes for Joe Biden. You’ll see that coming in. You’re going to see many of it.
Donald Trump: (01:08:06)
In some states, you had a little thing, a little problem, more votes than voters. A little problem. Take a look at Detroit. “Sir, they have many more votes than they have voters.” Oh, that doesn’t sound so good, does it? Huh? And they needed just a little bit, just a little bit. Didn’t need all, didn’t need much of it.
Donald Trump: (01:08:26)
For example, in Nevada it was recently discovered that 15 out of the state’s 17 counties had more votes than voters in 2020. Think of that, Nevada run by Democrats. Yeah, I wonder how that happened?
Donald Trump: (01:08:41)
In Arizona, 11,000 individuals are now listed as having voted who were not even on the roles the day after the election. They weren’t listed on the roles. None of the margins in the state, remember this, the margin was less than 11,000 substantially. So that was much more than we needed. That was just one of many categories.
Donald Trump: (01:09:08)
The Arizona auditors have also collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers abolished signature matching entirely. Okay, well that sounds reasonable. No signature. In other words, “Whose signature is it?” “We’re not allowed to match.” “Oh, that’s great.”
Donald Trump: (01:09:26)
Maricopa County has refused to comply with an official subpoena to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they indeed counted ballots with no signatures at all. Many of the ballots weren’t signed, they were just thrown in there.
Donald Trump: (01:09:44)
Finally, a recent trend analysis of all 50 states based on population growth, voter history and voter registration data by one of the most respected people in that industry. Somebody so respected, a military person, Captain Seth Keshel found over 8 million excess Biden votes. In other words, he had 8 million more votes that he’s supposed to have.
Speaker 8: (01:10:13)
Throw him in jail!
Donald Trump: (01:10:14)
And his estimate is conservative, he considered it very conservative. And I believe he said he didn’t even go to the machines. This is without even looking at the machines. Remember I’m not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I am the one trying to save American democracy.
Donald Trump: (01:10:43)
The numbers speak for themselves. We got 12 million more votes than in 2016. I was told by the best pollsters in the world… Real pollsters, not the phony pollsters that are used by certain of the fake news media… If I got 1 million more votes I couldn’t lose. I got 12 million more votes, and we lost.
Donald Trump: (01:11:09)
You know, Obama the second time got millions fewer votes than he did the first time. He won. But I was told by the most talented pollsters, and polling is talent. Polling works, but not when it’s fraudulent polling. “Get 1 million votes, sir, you cannot lose. It’ll be an easy early evening.” We got 12 million votes and they said we lost, but we didn’t.
Donald Trump: (01:11:33)
We won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, which is unprecedented. We flipped 15 House seats. Remember we were going to lose 25-35 House seats. Instead of losing 25 or 35, we won 15. It was a big evening. And you know why? Because, they came in on our coattails. That’s what happened. The Congressmen will tell you that. And women, they will tell you that.
Donald Trump: (01:12:02)
And did not lose a single Republican incumbent in Congress. Think of that. For the first time… Congressmen, we never think of that. This was in decades and decades, we didn’t lose one seat. You know why? I hate to say it, because of me. It’s because of me.
Donald Trump: (01:12:24)
Despite the pandemic, 56%, this was a record, of Americans… This is during the pandemic… believed that they were better off in 2020 than they were in 2016 when I assumed office. Think of that, 56% is a record. And we had a pandemic going. A majority of Americans, 55%, want audits of the votes. They want audits. And they want the forensic audits, they don’t want the bullshit audits. And 88% of the American citizens, of our citizens, of our great people are demanding voter ID.
Donald Trump: (01:13:20)
Thank you. Here tonight is someone who has fought harder than anyone else in Congress to expose the election fraud, he is really a fighter, and to defend the integrity of our elections. And I have to say it, I just can’t imagine him losing. He’s got courage. He’s an honest guy. He’s an honest guy. And that gives him the courage. Your next us Senator from Alabama, Mo Brooks. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:13:54)
I know Mo spoke, but come up and say just a quick word Mo. He’s doing very poorly in the polls, he’s only up at about 90%. Come on, Mo.
Mo Brooks: (01:14:09)
Thank you Mr. President, and future President of the United States of America. I’m pleased to announce the second coming of President Donald J. Trump.
Donald Trump: (01:14:30)
Go get them Mo. Thank you Mo. Mo is a fearless warrior for your sacred right to vote. And so many other things, he’s going to be an incredible Senator and we’re proud of him. And we’re proud of my cherish, your cherished, by my cherished Alabama. I feel like… I don’t know, The relationship. The relationship has been so strong. Right at the beginning, before I knew anything, I just knew we had a thing called common sense together. Thank you.
Speaker 8: (01:15:02)
We love you! We love you!
Donald Trump: (01:15:02)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:15:02)
… thing called common sense together. Thank you.
Audience: (01:15:17)
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.
Donald Trump: (01:15:17)
… everybody. Thank you. I love you too, but it is true. Early on I said, “How are we doing in Alabama?” “Sir, you’re up about 45 points.” This was before I knew any, I didn’t know what the hell it even meant. “45 points. That sounds good.” We’re up at the numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. We’ve never gone down, now we’re up higher than we ever were. And you also have somebody that is unbelievable. Unbelievable. He happens to be now a Senator. He was an unbelievable football coach, Tommy Tuberville. Tommy, stand up, Tommy. Where is Tommy? Where’s Tom? I love Tommy. Where the hell is he? Where is he? He’s here? The hell of a crowd. I want to tell you, this crowd goes so far back. See the cameras. We shouldn’t give that to the media because all they do is they block the view and they don’t say the truth, anyway.
Donald Trump: (01:16:17)
This crowd, see what this is? Goes hundreds of yards behind those cameras. Look at that. Man. Tommy, I love to see Tommy. I love Tommy. He’s doing a great job. I said, “Tommy, you you’re running for Senate.” And he did a good job. He was a natural and he was a rah-rah coach, but he was a great coach. I asked Urban Myers, “How good a coach was Tommy Tuberville?” He said, “He beat me twice. He’s the only one that beat me twice.” But I said, “Tommy, you beat Alabama six times.” I said, “How can you possibly expect the people of Alabama to vote for you?” He said, “Sir, because I gave them a coach named Sabin. Because of me they have…”
Donald Trump: (01:17:11)
I said, “Tommy, that’s the coolest answer I’ve ever heard.” And you voted him in and he’s been a great Senator. He’s been phenomenal. Thank you very much. Thank you, Tommy. Thank you very much. Credible guy, credible guy. And he’s got that look of a Senator. Doesn’t he? Not that looks matter. I always say looks don’t matter. You know, nowadays looks don’t matter, but he still got the look of a Senator. He’s doing a great job. Lieutenant governor, Will Ainsworth. Will, thank you, Will, great job. Nice meeting you backstage.
Donald Trump: (01:17:48)
Alabama Attorney General, Steve Marshall. Steve? Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Thank you very much. Representatives Jerry Carl, Barrymore, Gary Palmer. Robert, where’s Robert? Robert Aderholt. He’s been another one. Oh, and one of my favorite people. She’s so smart. I hope she’s around. I hope she’s around. She is an incredible woman. She’s a brilliant woman. Doesn’t get credit for it, but we all know about that stuff. Marjorie Taylor Green, Marjorie. Where is she? She’s great. She is great. She’s a warrior.
Donald Trump: (01:18:51)
A great gentlemen, Chief Justice of Alabama Supreme Court, Tom Parker. Tom, thank you very much. Thank you, Tom. A lot of power. State Senate president pro tem, Greg Reed. Greg, thank you very much. Thank you. State Senator Garland [inaudible 01:19:11]. Garland, thank you. State Representative Andrew Sirall. A man who’s done a fantastic job, Sheriff Matt Gentry. Thank you. Thank you, Matt. National committee man, Paul Reynolds. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:19:35)
Alabama GOP chair, this guy is amazing. You know what you raised tonight? A record in the history of the Republican party. And I think also in the history of the Democrat party, if we can say that. You raised $1.2 million. And I didn’t ask for anything, I should have. I made a mistake. Marjorie, I made a mistake. You know, normally I’ll say, all right, we’ll raise money, but you take half. We take half. We put it into my campaign. We put it… I just said the hell with it. Alabama is so good. Keep the whole damn thing. He raised $1.2 million. John Wall, John? Great job, great job, John.
Donald Trump: (01:20:20)
It’s a record. A patriot, a wonderful man, a man who puts his guts into everything. A man that they don’t treat properly. He’s smart. He loves this country so much. He’s willing to die for this country. I watched him over the last week at his symposium, which was really amazing. Some of the people he had were incredible, incredible people. Mike Lindell. Mike?
Donald Trump: (01:20:48)
It’s true. I’ll tell you true. It’s true He had some people up there really… I mean, there was scientists, they were political scientists and beyond, and they were incredible. What they said and what they understand. Also, want to thank for covering us. So incredibly well, two wonderful young people with unbelievable futures, Natalie Harp and Christina Bob. Did you ever hear them? They are unbelievable. Natalie Harp and Christina Bob, two incredible people. Thank you. Thank you very much for the job you do. Both of you. Unbelievable, an unbelievable job. What a good future you have.
Donald Trump: (01:21:45)
Under our administration, we’ve accomplished more in four short years than most presidents dream of accomplishing in eight years. We passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. Record setting regulation cuts. Nobody came close. Fair and reciprocal trade deals. We got rid of NAFTA. One of the worst deals ever made. Now we have the USMCA and we stood up to China like never before. We charged them tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We never took in 25 cents from China. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then we did it again. We had to do it twice and now it’s being destroyed, rapidly destroyed by what they’re doing with inflation and other things. We completely rebuilt the United States military. We created Space Force and we selected Huntsville, Alabama as the new headquarters of the US Space Command.
Donald Trump: (01:22:50)
I made a lot of enemies. I’ve made so many and a lot of states wanted it, but we put it in Alabama and that was not an easy one. You think this stuff is easy. It’s not so easy. By contrast, no administration in history has gotten off to a worst start then the Biden administration. There’s never been anything like this. And I thought about that statement before it happened with the disaster that we’re witnessing in Afghanistan. Joe Biden is a failed president. He will always be a failed president. He’s ushered in one calamity after another. When I left office, I handed Biden three vaccines to end the pandemic in record time, as I said, and yet under his leadership, the virus is surging back. Could you imagine if I were president and the virus was surging back? She said it wouldn’t be. It wouldn’t come back. Yeah, that one’s actually tougher than the Taliban. I must be honest with you. But he’s reimposing mask mandates and threatening new restrictions on the American people meanwhile. Many, many new restrictions. Meanwhile, 21% of migrant youth who recently crossed the border reportedly have COVID and they don’t have to do anything. They don’t have to wear masks. They don’t have to go through testing. They don’t have to do anything. And the country is being infected by what’s coming over the border. And not only with COVID. Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. And as I said, it’s okay for Russia, but no good for us. Remember when he said we will not approve the America first agenda. I said, that’s a killer statement. Isn’t it? But he actually believes that, America first, the greatest I think we’ve ever had, the greatest statement as to what we want to do with our country. And he said, “We are not for America first.” I said, did anybody actually tell him to say that?
Donald Trump: (01:25:03)
He attacked oil and gas workers here in America and caused gas prices to skyrocket, yet now he is begging OPEC for more production to please send energy our way. Please send oil gas to our country. And six months ago we had so much, we didn’t know what the hell to do with it. Unbelievable. He shut a lot of it down, had nothing to do with the environment. It’s called an environmental hoax. He did the exact opposite. I broke OPEC and I broke the cartel. You saw what was happening. We actually had a moment in time where oil prices went down per barrel to minus $37. In other words, if you took a barrel of oil, they gave you $37. I told my people, why didn’t you do that? We would’ve gotten paid to take the oil. That was too much because it was going to destroy our industry. But we did fill up the national oil reserves that were empty for years. And we filled them up with very cheap oil. And now Biden wants to use that to supplement what we have. We shouldn’t do that.
Donald Trump: (01:26:17)
We achieved American energy independence, and we turned America into the number one energy super power in the world. We were bigger than Saudi Arabia by a lot. We were bigger than Russia by a lot. And now we’re going back to them asking them for help. Do you believe this? Biden and the radical Democrats are also pushing a $4.7 trillion spending Bonanza that is nothing but a down payment on the socialist Green New Deal. Build your buildings. Please don’t put windows in your building. That’s one of the ones that we don’t want windows to be in the building. And if they are, they want them to be very small. Take the buildings down in New York and build new buildings with smaller windows.
Donald Trump: (01:27:05)
Between the phony infrastructure bill and the budget proposal, their package would abolish the suburbs, totally abolish. They said I lost people in the suburbs. I’m the one that got them to stop building horrible low-income housing that was going to destroy the suburbs. And they’re saying that I didn’t do well in the suburbs. I think I did great in the suburbs. I think the women in suburbs voted for Donald Trump. That’s what I think. I do think. We had a rigged election. They give Congress unchecked authority to raise your taxes. You will be getting the biggest tax increase in history if they’re allowed to do what they are trying to do, allow the government to try taxing America drivers by the mile. They want to tax you by the mile and grant a backdoor mass amnesty to illegal aliens. The radical Democrat party and their media allies are completely and totally corrupt. The same people who want you to believe there was no election fraud are the ones who said there was no spying in my campaign.
Donald Trump: (01:28:16)
Remember, they spied my campaign? I said, “They’re spying on my campaign,” and the world went crazy. I thought it was just an innocent statement because we know they’re dishonest. The world went crazy when I said they’re spying and it turned out that to be true. They perpetrated the Russia hoax. They framed General Flynn. They conducted the Mueller witch hunt, never ending Mueller witch hunt. They’re continuing to do it with very dishonest, highly political prosecutors, all over the place. They’re using justice to go after Republicans. And we can’t let that happen, because again, we’re not going to have a country left. And they pushed the impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two, who ruthlessly smeared Brett Kavanaugh. Do you remember how they went after Brett Kavanaugh? He was with this one. He was with that one. He wasn’t with any of them. And they knew that, but you know, they’re trying to scare our Supreme Court.
Donald Trump: (01:29:22)
And they’re trying to scare people like Bill Barr and others. By going after him, they try and scare him because they say they’re going to pack the court or they’re going to impeach Bill Barr. And you know, it changes some people. It really does. It changes them. It scares them. They don’t want that to happen. They talk about, they want to impeach Kavanaugh. You know what they want to impeach him for? Nothing. He didn’t do anything wrong. In fact, the opposite, they did everything wrong. They were total dishonest people. One of the most horrendous hearings that anyone’s seen, they covered up the origins of the China virus. And they censored all information about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and all of the corruption in that family.
Donald Trump: (01:30:06)
Just recently, it was revealed that Google rewrote its whole program. You saw that, in order to target Donald Trump, they targeted me. And yet, we still got 75 million votes. How the hell did we do that? But really the number wasn’t 75 million. I believe the number was many, many, many millions more. You know, it’s funny. I have a rally like this that goes way the hell back. By the way, it’s starting to rain. I will prove to you it’s my hair.
Donald Trump: (01:30:50)
But everyone in here knows that the radical left will stop at nothing to destroy the America we love. We’re not going to let it happen. All of you in Alabama and with conservative patriots like Mo Brooks and others and all of the names I mentioned are fighting for us in Washington. And I have never been more confident that we will defeat the radical left. And we have to. We don’t have a choice. These are vicious people and they stick together. They don’t have Mitt Romney and these guys that go off on their own, they don’t have people like that. Little Ben Sasse. He said nothing. They don’t have people like this. They have people that stick together. I respect them for that, but I don’t respect them for trying to destroy our country.
Donald Trump: (01:31:39)
With a Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for American families, fair trade for American workers. And we’ve done more on trade deals than any other administration in the history of our country, including the China deal, which I don’t even talk about it anymore because of COVID but the China deal has made our farmers rich. Our farmers and manufacturers have never done better. And more American factories, forging more products stamped with that very beautiful phrase, made in the USA.
Donald Trump: (01:32:18)
So in conclusion, our movement is up against some of the most sinister forces and entrenched interests that anyone can even imagine. But no matter how big our way of life, no matter how big our country or how powerful they may seem, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage. And our magnificent American Liberty is your God given right. The citizens of the United States of America will not be dictated to and talked down to by incompetent politicians, corrupt tyrants, left-wing bullies, or socialist bureaucrats in Washington, DC, a place that I got to know very, very well.
Donald Trump: (01:33:25)
We are descended from the heroes and the patriots, the pioneers and the legends who tame the great wilderness, who settled this vast continent and who laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest-
Donald Trump: (01:33:55)
… we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. And there is no challenge we cannot meet. We are Americans and the future belongs to us. We’re going to have a great future. We are going to turn this mess around. This is a horrible thing that’s happening to our country. We’re left out all over the world. We’re not going to be left at anymore. This is a horrible, horrible thing. And it’s going to go on for awhile, but we’ve got to end it. We cannot let this happen. They’re destroying our country. We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never, ever surrender.
Donald Trump: (01:34:50)
My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun. In the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this. There’s never been anything like it. People run for the Senate. They do okay. They lose. They win a couple of votes and they’re national heroes for 50 years. They’re on television, talking. People running for president and they come in second, third, or fourth in one primary. And they’re national heroes all of a sudden. We, not me. We ran for president and we won 32 states. And then we did better the second time, much better the second time, much, much better. Somebody from the fake news media said, “Sir, what was the difference between 2016 and 2020?” I said, “Well, the difference was that in 2020, we did much, much better. The rallies were bigger. The enthusiasm was more.”
Donald Trump: (01:35:56)
Because in 2016, I told you what we were going to do, but it was talk. In 2020, you knew that I did it. So we had a much better, but we were cheated. And it was rigged. We were cheated, but there’s never been a movement like this. And you know, it’s funny. I say it a lot. And with the fake news, look at all of them back there, the fake news is back there. They never ever question it. If I say something that’s close to wrong, it’s headline news. But I say, this is the greatest rally in the history of our country, this is the greatest movement in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like it.
Donald Trump: (01:36:41)
And it’s probably the greatest movement in the history of our world. It’s probably, this movement. Call it, make America great again, call it America first, call it what you will. I believe it’s the greatest movement probably in the history of the world. It’s just starting. It’s just starting. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So with love of our nation, swelling in our hearts, and it does swell in your hearts. That’s why you’re standing here in the rain, listening to this person. You’re saying, “Darling, it’s raining. Let’s go home.” But nobody is leaving all the way back hundreds and like football fields behind, football fields. “Darling, it’s raining,” but they say, “We’re not going home because we love our country.”
Donald Trump: (01:37:40)
But with swelling in our hearts, the spirit of America is stirring ourselves. And I say these words to you, and you’ve heard these words before, in some cases many times before, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America, despite what you’re seeing today so sad and so pathetic, we will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And you know what it is, we will make America great again. Thank you Alabama. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much.

			Sean Hannity: (00:00)
Mr. President, thank you for being with us.
Sean Hannity: (00:02)
Let me go back. I have had a number of people tell me that there were very specific conditions and very specific warnings that you gave personally to the Taliban. Joe Biden is trying to blame you.
Sean Hannity: (00:17)
I want first to give you an opportunity to respond to that, your assessment of what’s going on. And what was that conversation, to the extent you feel you’re able to share it with us?
Donald Trump: (00:29)
Well, it’s good to be with you, Sean, but it’s a terrible time for our country. I don’t think, in all of the years, our country has ever been so humiliated. I don’t know. Would you call it a military defeat or a psychological defeat? There’s never been anything like what’s happened here.
Donald Trump: (00:46)
You can go back to Jimmy Carter with the hostages. We all thought that was a great embarrassment. And we were pulled out of that by Ronald Reagan. This is many, many times worse. And you’re dealing with thousands and thousands of Americans and others that are stranded and very dangerously really stranded in Afghanistan. So, it’s something that you can’t even believe that a thing like this could…
Donald Trump: (01:11)
I looked at that big monster cargo plane yesterday with people grabbing the side and trying to get flown out of Afghanistan because of their fear, their incredible fear. And they’re blowing off the plane from 2,000 feet up in the air. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that. That blows the helicopters in Vietnam away. That’s not even a contest. This has been the most humiliating period of time I have ever seen.
Donald Trump: (01:36)
Yeah, we had a great deal. We worked on it very hard. Mike Pompeo, a brilliant guy, and many others worked on it endlessly, meetings with the Taliban. Of course, you have to meet with the Taliban. They’re the ones that you’re negotiating with. I spoke on numerous occasions to the head of the Taliban and we had a very strong conversation. I told him up front, I said: “Look, before we start, let me just tell you right now that if anything bad happens to Americans or anybody else, or if you ever come over to our land, we will hit you with a force that no country has ever been hit with before, a force so great that you won’t even believe it. And your village, and we know where it is…” and I named it, “will be the first one.”
Sean Hannity: (02:21)
Mr. President, I want to interrupt.
Donald Trump: (02:22)
“The first bombs will be dropped right there.”
Sean Hannity: (02:24)
You said this to who?
Donald Trump: (02:25)
Yeah.
Sean Hannity: (02:26)
You said that to who?
Donald Trump: (02:29)
To Mullah Baradar, who is probably the top person now. Nobody really knows who the top person is, but I would say that’s probably the top person. And it seems to be that’s the way it’s rolling right now, but I had a very strong conversation. I also had a good conversation with him. We talked for a while after that. That was the primary point I was making and he understood it.
Donald Trump: (02:55)
And I asked him, “Do you understand?”
Donald Trump: (02:56)
He said, “Yes, I do understand.”
Donald Trump: (02:58)
And I wanted them to get a deal done with the Afghan government. Now, I never had a lot of confidence, frankly, in Ghani. I said that openly and plainly. I thought he was a total crook. I thought he got away with murder. He spent all his time wining and dining our senators. And the senators were in his pocket. That was one of the problems that we had. But I never liked him. And I guess, based on his escape with cash… I don’t know, maybe that’s a true story. I would suspect it is. All you have to do is look at his lifestyle, study his houses where he lives. He got away with murder in many different ways.
Donald Trump: (03:34)
But I had a very, very strong talk with the Taliban, which I considered to be much more important in this sense, because they were the problem. And they have been there for a long time. And they’re good fighters and they fight hard. And after I said that, we had a pretty good conversation.
Donald Trump: (03:51)
Now, I have to tell you that, if you remember, when they were coming to Washington to meet with me, they decided to kill an American soldier, because they thought that was a good way to negotiate. And I canceled the trip. And we had a conditions-based agreement. And if you remember, it said May 1, we want to get out, because we have to get out.
Donald Trump: (04:11)
I have listened to people on your show and other shows say we should stay. They don’t know. We were spending $42 billion a year, $42 billion. Think of it, $42 billion. I understand Russia spends $50 billion a year for their entire military. We were spending $42 billion, not 1%. They were saying 1%. That’s a lot of nonsense. We’re spending $42 billion a year on defending this for years and years. We’re in there really now, not 20 years, but 21-and-a-half years. And we get nothing out of any of these things that we do, whether it’s them or many other countries I could tell you about. I’m not going to insult anybody right now. But to spend that kind of money, and then to have people get on shows and say how inexpensive it was…
Donald Trump: (04:58)
And I have to tell you also that we lost no soldiers in the last year-and-a-half because of me and because of the understanding that we had. We lost no… Think of that. In Chicago and in New York and in other cities in the United States, many people die every weekend. We lost no soldiers in Afghanistan because they knew I wasn’t going to put up with it. And that’s what happened. So, we had a very strong conversation.
Sean Hannity: (05:26)
Let me ask you this, sir. It’s interesting to listen to Joe Biden blame you. “I inherited this deal,” he kept saying, but he also inherited secure borders, and he also inherited energy independence. And he also inherited three vaccines and therapeutics like Regeneron. And we now see what’s been unfolding and he didn’t have inflation at the time.
Sean Hannity: (05:48)
I want to go back. I want to be very clear here, because Secretary of State Pompeo on this program said exactly what you did, that there wouldn’t be an exit strategy that didn’t include the current conditions on the ground. And I have multiple sources, and you’re confirming tonight that it sounds to me like you told the Taliban that, if they violated any aspect of this agreement with territorial ambitions… We learned last week that 60% of the country was in their control. And you told them in no uncertain terms, it sounds to me like you would basically treat them like you took care of the caliphate in Syria, ISIS.
Donald Trump: (06:32)
Well, we did. We got rid of the caliphate. Everyone said it was impossible, and I did it very quickly. And I let the generals make the decisions, the generals, the real generals, the ones that were over there doing the fighting, the ones that knew how to do it, because we have a lot of generals that shouldn’t be generals right now, frankly. And I’m watching them all the time. But we have some great ones. We have great leaders in our military. We have the greatest military in the world and we’re giving it a very bad reputation, what’s happening.
Donald Trump: (06:59)
Think of it. We took this horrible place, I mean, a place that just we shouldn’t have been in involved. It was a horrible decision going into the Middle East. And I know the Bush family will not be happy, but I believe it was the worst decision in the history of our country when we decided to go into the Middle East. It’s turned out to be quicksand. We have destroyed the Middle East. Do you think it’s better now than it was 20, 21 years ago? It’s much worse. It was a horrible decision, cost us trillions of dollars and, if you look at both sides, because I like to look at both sides, millions and millions of lives. And it’s no different than it was. It’s much worse, because you have to rebuild it. It has been blown to pieces. The worst decision ever made was going. You could do a strike as retribution, and it could be a big strike, as retribution for the World Trade Center, et cetera, but to get stuck in there, it was like quicksand. So, we did a terrible thing.
Donald Trump: (07:57)
But think of what’s happening now. I have heard as many as 40,000 Americans. And the Taliban, good fighters, I will tell you, they’re good fighters. We have to give them credit for that. They have been fighting for 1,000 years. That’s what they do, is they fight. The Taliban has circled the airport. And who knows if they’re going to treat us right. You know, all of a sudden, they will say, “Well…” Frankly, if they were smart, then really… And they are smart, and they are smart. They should let the Americans out. But we have had situations where you have two or three or four hostages. We could have 40,000 Americans, not to mention others, like people that helped us in Afghanistan.
Donald Trump: (08:37)
So, we have never had a situation like this. We have 40,000 potential hostages, a minimum-
Sean Hannity: (08:44)
We don’t know how many.
Donald Trump: (08:44)
… of 11,000, but it could be as many as 40.
Donald Trump: (08:47)
No, they have no idea how many. Nobody knows how many. They don’t know anything.
Sean Hannity: (08:51)
When Joe Biden told the country that he trusted that the Afghan military was so far superior, and there were over 300,000-strong, and they had an air force, and we wouldn’t see what happened in Saigon, he couldn’t have been more wrong. But let me go back to the words you used to the Taliban leader, because we knew last week that 60% of the country had already been taken over by the Taliban. And there was no sense of urgency to me.
Sean Hannity: (09:18)
Under your plan, if they had taken over 5%, not 60, like they had last… 5% that was not in your agreement, what would have happened to them?
Donald Trump: (09:30)
We would have hit them very hard. Again, the words are conditions, plural, conditions-based. It was an agreement where, actually, we wanted to get out by May 1, and they violated the agreement. So, we didn’t. It’s a great agreement from a lot of different standpoints. And, frankly, Biden didn’t have to even go by that agreement. He could have done… Look what he’s done to the border. We had the greatest border, Southern border, in the history of our country. We stopped drugs. We stopped human trafficking. We stopped people from coming in, prisoners from coming in. Now-
Donald Trump: (10:03)
We stopped people from coming in, prisoners from coming in. Now you have the worst people in the world. They’re emptying their jails into our country. This is like the Southern border but it’s handled even worse. Nobody handled the Southern border worse than him. We had the most secure border we’ve ever had. Now we have, by far the worst border we’ve ever had.
Donald Trump: (10:20)
Well, Afghanistan is the exact same thing. To think of this, we have a military, it’s holding it. I got to reduce down to 2,500 soldiers and they were doing a good job. It was fine. It was a smaller force. I took it down from close to 20 to 2,500 and we were fine, but we have the military there and we take the military out before we took our civilians out and before we took the interpreters and other, we want to try and help.
Donald Trump: (10:49)
But by the way, I’m America first, okay? The Americans come out first, but we’re also going to help people that helped us. And we have to be very careful with the vetting because you have some rough people in there, but we’re going to help those people, but can you imagine?
Donald Trump: (11:02)
Now what we were going to do just very quickly is we were going to take the military out last, okay? Last. The people were coming out. They were going to come out, but the agreement was violated, so I held things back because we weren’t going to do anything again, conditions based.
Sean Hannity: (11:19)
Well, we will be debating.
Donald Trump: (11:20)
So they weren’t fulfilling their obligations and condition, but here’s… Just to finish. The people come out first, then I was going to take all of the military equipment. We have billions and billions of dollars worth of new Black Hawk helicopters, brand new that Russia now will be examining and so will China and so will everybody else to figure it, because it’s the greatest in the world.
Donald Trump: (11:42)
We have brand new army tanks and all sorts of equipment, missiles. We have everything. I was going to take it out because I knew they weren’t going to fight. Just one thing, and I have to say, and this is different from everyone else. I said, “Why are they fighting? Why are these Afghan soldiers fighting against the Taliban?” And I was told some very bad information by a lot of different people.
Donald Trump: (12:06)
The fact is they’re among the highest paid soldiers in the world. They were doing it for a paycheck because once we stopped, once we left, they stopped fighting. So all of the people that talk about the bravery and everything, I say everybody’s brave. But the fact is our country was paying the Afghan soldiers a fortune.
Donald Trump: (12:26)
So we were sort of bribing them to fight. And that’s not what it’s all about. It’s a great thing that we’re getting out, but nobody has ever handled a withdrawal worse than Joe Biden. This is the greatest embarrassment, I believe, in the history of our country.
Sean Hannity: (12:43)
Mr. President, we don’t know how many Americans are trapped behind enemy lines. We know that the Taliban have set up a perimeter around the airport. I guess the question is, how do we get our people home now? What you advise? What would you do if you were put into this situation right now and dropped in and you were to take over? What is the answer? Because we don’t know where they are.
Sean Hannity: (13:09)
Senator Tom Cotton literally said that people are being told to go to a website. “Don’t call anymore, go to our website,” he said. I’m like, “Please tell me we have a better plan than that.” Joe’s been on vacation. I just heard that apparently he landed back at the White House. Nice of him to return.
Donald Trump: (13:28)
And he only returned because he was getting terrible press, okay? He didn’t return for any other reason. And I don’t even believe he’s calling the shots. Look, what you need more than anything is a president that’s respected. You need a president that got rid of ISIS. We 100% got rid of ISIS. We did a job, Al Baghdadi. I won’t even mention all of the things that we did. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done.
Donald Trump: (13:55)
We were respected all over the world. China was paying us billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. Companies were moving back into our country and China respected us. And frankly, they respected me. But you look, Russia, I had the pipeline stopped. Totally stopped. Biden comes in. He approves that pipeline, but he disapproves the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Donald Trump: (14:19)
You need a president that’s respected. I’ve never realized how important frankly, and it’s a horrible thing to say, how important a president, the head of this country is? I thought it would maybe run through bureaucracy. It doesn’t. You need somebody up there that they’re going to respect. So when they say, “Oh, he talked to the Taliban, you remember they were criticizing me.”
Donald Trump: (14:41)
They criticized me when I talked to Kim Jong-un. Well, President Biden told me it’s the single biggest problem we have. I said, “Have you ever called him? Have you ever talked to him?” “No, I haven’t.” He did try but he was not receptive on the other side, but he was receptive with me.
Donald Trump: (14:58)
Now we were supposed to have a war and probably a very big nuclear war. I get along with him great and I got along with him great. He doesn’t like Biden much, I’ll tell you that. But I got along with him great and we had no problems. You remember that? We were virtual-
Sean Hannity: (15:13)
I was there.
Donald Trump: (15:14)
Remember the big button versus the little button and all thing. Let me just… We get along great. We had a very good relationship. We met, we got no credit for that one. No problem. By the way, South Korea, I got them to pay billions of dollars. Billions. We’re protecting South Korea. They’re very wealthy. They build the ships. They build the televisions. They’ve built… They do everything. They’re very rich.
Donald Trump: (15:38)
They were paying us nothing. I got them to pay billions and billions of dollars because we’re protecting them from North Korea. And I had a very good relationship with President Moon and all of the people in South Korea. In fact, they liked me and I liked them, but I said, “Why are we doing this for nothing?”
Donald Trump: (15:56)
Japan, the same thing. So many… We’re protecting the world. We can’t do this. We’re not supposed to be doing this. If you look at Russia, if you look at China, how many countries are they fighting for? One, you ask them. They’re fighting for Russia, they’re fighting for China. They’re not fighting for 93 different countries all over the world. Most of them, I mean, nobody ever heard of them. So we had a very, very strong conversation with the Mullah. And frankly, it absolutely is interesting.
Sean Hannity: (16:30)
[crosstalk 00:16:30]
Donald Trump: (16:30)
They would not have done what they’ve done right now. This is the greatest embarrassment and beyond embarrassment. This is something that will affect our relationships for years to come and decades to come. I will say when China watches this, they’re so happy and they’re laughing at us. They’re laughing. I extracted billions and billions of dollars out of China. It never happened.
Donald Trump: (16:54)
We never got 25 cents from China. Billions and billions. They was so happy to see a rigged election. They might’ve helped it along actually, but they were so happy. But Sean, I’ll tell you what, this is the greatest embarrassment that I’ve ever seen. This is… And you know it better than… You do an incredible job in covering it and I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it.
Donald Trump: (17:15)
This is the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country. There’s never been… And let me tell you, we haven’t stopped. This is not ending again. We have all of those thousands of Americans over there and others, and you’re saying, ” How are they going to get…” They have a Taliban ring around the airport and they said, “Nobody else now.”
Donald Trump: (17:35)
They’re saying we’ll negotiate. But I really… Do you really think… I mean, their history is that they’re very brutal and they don’t like to negotiate. That’s their history and Biden put us in this position. He should have gotten the civilians out first. Then he should have taken the military equipment.
Donald Trump: (17:52)
We have billions of dollars of brand new, beautiful equipment. Take the equipment out and then take the soldiers out. And frankly, I said, take the soldiers out. But before you leave, blow up all the forts because we built these forts that are being now used by the enemy. It’s not even believable.
Sean Hannity: (18:11)
They left everything. It’s interesting because I’m watching both Russia and China race in and they want to recognize the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan almost immediately. It’s funny. I mentioned to you that I had numerous sources that said that, apparently a lot of people are on your phone calls.
Sean Hannity: (18:30)
I know everyone wanted to release the Ukraine call. They said, “What we really need to do is release the calls between president Trump and the head of the Taliban. And maybe while we’re at it, we can release some of the calls with President Trump and President Xi because America might be shocked to hear how strong you were and forceful you are in a lot of these conversations,” which leads me to a question about what’s going on with China and Russia.
Sean Hannity: (18:56)
They’re both arming Iran putting that aside. But China in particular has threatened our military bases, Japan’s military bases. They lectured our country in front of our Secretary of State, not Mike Pompeo, Blinken in anchorage about human rights of all things after COVID.
Sean Hannity: (19:15)
And then the communist Chinese are saying we need to beg for permission to land in Taiwan and their propaganda newspapers suggesting that America won’t lift a finger to help our ally, Taiwan. If in fact they have reunification, which we both means they want to take over Taiwan. And I’m not sure I disagree with that assessment. I don’t believe Joe Biden would lift a finger to help Taiwan. Your thoughts on the new aggressive nature of China.
Donald Trump: (19:50)
Well, I had a great relationship with President Xi, a really great relationship. We got along great until COVID, even though I taxed the hell out of him through the tariffs, they weren’t happy. But I had a very good relationship and we met at-
Donald Trump: (20:03)
They weren’t happy, but I had a very good relationship, and we met at Mar-a-Lago, and I told him very strongly, “Do not do anything having to do with Taiwan. Just don’t do it.” And I said it much stronger than that. I’m not going to say exactly how, but it was said very strongly. This wasn’t a call, this was sitting in a sofa at Mar-a-Lago, where a meeting that was supposed to last 15 minutes before we went on to various other things with our different people, but it lasted for hours. We got along great.
Donald Trump: (20:33)
The first half hour, I said, “Do not do anything having to do with Taiwan. I know you want to, do not do it.” Anyway, then the election gets rigged and we end up with a different president. And what happens, there are bombers now last week, 28 bombers flying over Taiwan. And this happened a week after the election. They were all of a sudden, I think bad things are going to happen with respect to Taiwan because they don’t respect our leadership and they no longer respect our country. And that’s a really bad thing, China does not respect us any longer. And they had more respect for us just seven months ago than they ever had for this country.
Sean Hannity: (21:17)
Let me ask you about, the border was one of your big issues, sir. You had put in place a Stay in Mexico policy, you built over 500 miles of border wall, you ended Catch and Release. Okay. Well, now the Stay in Mexico policy is gone, the wall construction has ended, and it’s no longer Catch and Release, it’s process and release in the middle of a pandemic. You’ve see in the cages that are overcrowded with all these illegal immigrants, a high rate of COVID positivity, there’s no vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, mass mandates for illegal immigrants that many states are putting and burdening American people with. Those people are then being dispersed all over the country. Wow! A big change that seven months can make, and now it’s going to be millions of people. What was your reaction? What is your reaction?
Donald Trump: (22:12)
I’ve never seen anything like what was happening and what is happening now at our Southern border, all he had to do is nothing. We had the greatest Remain in Mexico, people weren’t even allowed into our country. And we won that in the courts, it was very tough. The wall was almost completed. It could have been built in another month, they delayed with two and a half years, when the Democrats in Congress sued me. We never had a border anywhere like it.
Donald Trump: (22:39)
And then almost immediately they ended these policies, Catch and Release, you catch them and release them into our country, instead of catching them and bringing them back to their country. And many of these people are stone cold and very hard convicts and prisoners, they’re very tough. I mean, literally, as I said, they are emptying their jails. And not just the three countries, not just Honduras, and Guatemala, and El Salvador, many countries are coming in and they’re emptying out their prisons and letting them come into our country. And they’re walking in in caravans and other ways. What’s happening?
Donald Trump: (23:15)
So I never saw anything so stupid in my life until the last few days with Afghanistan, that blows the stupidity of the Southern border. What happened and what is happening in Afghanistan is unbelievable. And we’re being set up by very tough people that are very great negotiators. I’ll tell you what, they’re automatically great negotiators. They’ve been fighting for a thousand years, and everything about them, they negotiate. We’re being set up. They have all of those people, and in a certain way, I guarantee you, they consider them to be hostages. And let’s see what happens over the coming weeks. But this is not a story that just ended today or yesterday, this is a story that’s going to go on for a long time, and it could be a very, very bad ending.
Sean Hannity: (24:01)
We have Americans caught behind enemy lines right now, and we were told this could never happen, and it happened. Let me ask you about energy. One of the reasons I had, for many years, been an advocate of energy independence, because what happens in the Straits of Hormuz and in the Middle East are not really that important. You accomplished something in your administration, I don’t think you got a lot of credit for, but you made America energy independent for the first time in 75 years. I don’t think in the last months of your administration, you imported a single barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia, for example, not one.
Donald Trump: (24:39)
Zero.
Sean Hannity: (24:39)
And now we just had in the last two weeks, Joe Biden, begging OPEC to increase production because it still is the lifeblood of the world’s economy. My question is, with gas up $1.30 a gallon, this is now a new tax on the American people, that means the cost of delivering every single product in every grocery store, drug store, every Homes Depot, and Lowe’s, is costing Americans more. And inflation on top of it at 5.4%, a 15-year high, your reaction to that aspect of the economy alone.
Donald Trump: (25:17)
So energy independence was one of my greatest achievements, I thought. I think the vaccine, energy independence, what we did on the border, frankly, Afghanistan would have been great, we would have been out, and we would have been out with dignity and with pride and it would have worked out great, none of this stuff going, this though. Again, it’s not the concept of leaving, it’s the way they withdrew, it was not even possible to believe. But gasoline, as you know, was a $1.87 when I was leaving office, and now it’s going to be up to over $5 very soon. And they’re talking to OPEC. I know the OPEC people very well. You talk about negotiators, they’re killing us. And what you didn’t say is that Biden failed with OPEC. They told him no on the cutbacks, they failed with OPEC.
Donald Trump: (26:10)
To think that we’re back to negotiating with OPEC, that’s how we got into the Middle East years ago because we needed the energy, and we went into the Middle East and would protect countries because we needed the energy. We didn’t have to do that anymore, we were energy independent. And now, those wells are shut down and those jobs are gone. And Keystone is, and it’s number is 48,000 jobs not 8,000 jobs. And they lied in the campaign because Biden never talked about closing up Keystone. He said, “Oh, well, we’ll look at it. We’ll look at it.” They were lying because it was almost the first day that they closed up Keystone and those workers are devastated. And the head of the union, they all support me, but the head of the union supported Biden and they got to throw him the hell out because he was worthless because look what happened. But they lied about so many things. They lied about energy, they lied about Keystone, they lied about the military, they lied about so much. Our country is in such trouble, such trouble.
Sean Hannity: (27:12)
Mr. President, you touched on Russia, I want to go back to it because we saw these massive cyber attacks in their energy grid and also our food line, especially with our meats in this country. And then we also witnessed, and you referenced it earlier in the interview, the waiver that you prevented Vladimir Putin from getting, which allowed him to build the pipeline, that is literally the lifeblood of the economy of our allies in Western Europe, while simultaneously cutting out the Keystone XL pipeline, high-paying career jobs for Americans. And I’ve got to ask, because if it was you or your sons, and let’s see, what do they have in common? Russia, Hunter Biden got a lot of money, China, they didn’t do a deal with Goldman Sachs, they didn’t do a deal with Deutsche Bank, they did a deal with Hunter Biden, 1,000,000,005 with the Bank of China.
Sean Hannity: (28:10)
And again, Joe Biden has said nothing to threats against our military or “reunification” threats with Taiwan, or you must get permission to land an airplane in Taiwan, which I never thought would happen or get lectured on human rights. My question then is, if the last name was Trump and your sons were making money in China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, if your sons lied on a gun application and threw that gun in a garbage basket or wastebasket, if your sons were on video smoking crack and with hookers, would the question not logically become, do you believe these countries have compromising materials, potentially, the very thing, you remember, Adam Schiff, “compromising materials on Trump”, when they didn’t have it and he was being scammed. Do you see any potential for compromise here? Because it doesn’t make sense to me to give Putin a waiver.
Donald Trump: (29:07)
So this story, the new tape that just came out two days ago has not been on any mainstream media at all. It was on your show and a couple of shows, but no mainstream, it wasn’t an NBC, or CBS, or ABC, it wasn’t on CNN, it wasn’t on any, it’s Hunter Biden, and it’s the worst thing I’ve seen. You can’t even imagine this. And look, I hope families live well, but what they’re doing is they’re doing political persecutions with their prosecutors, whether they’re local or federal and our people didn’t do that, the Republicans don’t do it anywhere. I mean, it’s like a different world. They use prosecutors for persecution, and it’s happening. And our country is angry about it and they see it. But what’s going on with Hunter and China and Russia and all of that. I mean, they go after people for much, for tiny…
Donald Trump: (30:03)
Yeah. And all of that. They go after people for tiny little things. And here’s somebody that took vast amounts of money out of China and out of Ukraine and out of Russia, three and a half million dollars from the mayor’s wife and Chris Wallace. Wouldn’t let me talk about that during a debate. He wouldn’t even let me bring it up. Well, that has nothing to do. I said, “It has a lot to do with it.”
Donald Trump: (30:22)
But it’s a very sad period of time for our country. Everything’s going bad. We have inflation. The economy is going to go to hell. We have inflation like we haven’t seen in a long time. I think it’s much worse if you look just at energy. And when energy goes up, everything goes up because it’s all about energy. Everything goes up. But you look at the price of food where it’s being doubled and tripled in some cases, we’re going to have inflation.
Donald Trump: (30:48)
And I remember with Jimmy Carter … and the good thing is for Jimmy is that Jimmy’s looking like a much better president right now because you always have to have comparisons. But I remember with Jimmy Carter with a big inflation, the prime rate went to 21%, 21% and the country came to a halt. Worse than a halt. Well, I’ll tell you, we better get our act together. That’s all I can say.
Donald Trump: (31:13)
You look at what’s going on with our economy and with inflation and so many other things. ANWR in Alaska, biggest drilling site in the world, I got it open. Ronald Reagan couldn’t do it. Nobody could do it for 60, 7 … They’d been trying for 60, 70 years, I got it done. And it was just terminated. The biggest site in the world, probably bigger than Saudi Arabia in terms of oil. I got it done and they just terminated it. And the people of Alaska are very upset. Okay. They are very upset with Senator Murkowski and others.
Sean Hannity: (31:50)
They made money.
Donald Trump: (31:50)
But here’s the greatest thing. And they ended it. So we had energy independence and now we don’t.
Sean Hannity: (31:56)
Instead of begging OPEC, Governor Abbott … We’re praying for him tonight. I know that he announced that he had COVID today, another breakthrough case. Instead of begging OPEC, why don’t we just go back to doing what was working for you instead of allowing millions of people into this country with a high rate of COVID positivity in the middle of pandemic and then dispersing them all around the country, why don’t we go back to the stay in Mexico policy, the border wall building, and process and release and protect our borders? They seem to be things that can be solidly resolved.
Donald Trump: (32:39)
They could all be done. Yeah. Well, nothing’s simple. The things we want on the border were won through courts. It took a long time. And then all of a sudden they gave them up. We had to make deals with Mexico. The President of Mexico is a great guy. We’re very friendly and we did a deal. I had 28,000 soldiers paid for by Mexico, his soldiers on the border, not letting people in, and we didn’t pay anything. I promised not to tariff his cars during this period, but that’s okay, whatever it takes. But we didn’t have people coming in during the construction of the wall. And the wall worked. We built almost 500 miles. They could finish it in a month. Now they’re paying billions of dollars not to finish the wall. It’s not even believable. And the contractors that haven’t been … They’re just having a field day. But when you look at all of this stupidity, I don’t think our country can take it. And I don’t think our people can take it, either.
Sean Hannity: (33:29)
Let me ask you, the American people now watching, what will be a 25 to 30 year record of illegal immigrants coming into the country when you had set a 25 year low of illegal immigrants coming into the country. The American people now, many are angry about mask mandates, vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, but none of these restrictions are being applied to people that are not respecting our laws, our borders, and our sovereignty. How do you explain that? And do you support the restrictions on Americans, but not illegal immigrants?
Donald Trump: (34:03)
Yeah. First of all, the border, it’s not 25 years, it’s the worst in history. It’s not the worst in 25 years. We’ve never had a situation where massive caravans of people are pouring into our country. So it’s the worst ever.
Donald Trump: (34:16)
As far as the vaccine, I’m very proud of it. I pushed the FDA like they’ve never been pushed. They don’t like me too much. I’m not so sure I like them. Very bureaucratic, but I got them to approve a great vaccine, three of them, in a period of less than nine months. I was told by Fauci and everybody else it would take three to five years and probably five and it probably won’t even happen. And I got it done in less than nine months. So I consider it a great achievement. I actually think that if we didn’t get it done, worldwide, you would have another Spanish flu, which killed almost a hundred million people according to history. 50 to a hundred, they don’t even know. But I would love people to take the vaccine. In the meantime, wear your mask if you want but, again, you want your freedoms. You have to have your freedoms.
Sean Hannity: (35:06)
I know the obvious question as we head with the last minute of the program available is, are you considering a run again in 2024? I’ll let you answer it any way you want, but I’ll go back to our original question. Now that we have all these Americans behind enemy lines, in the 45 seconds we have left, what would you do now to help them with that specific situation?
Donald Trump: (35:33)
So, because the campaign finance laws are extremely complicated and unbelievably stupid, I’m actually not allowed to answer that question. Can you believe it? I’d love to answer it. But let me put it this way. I think you’ll be happy. And I think a lot of our friends will be very happy, but I’m not actually allowed to answer it. It makes it very difficult if I do. So people, you’re going to be happy because I love this country and I hate to see what’s happening to it. As far as if you look at-
Sean Hannity: (35:57)
Would you be willing to get on the phone with the people that you gave very harsh words to and talk to them on behalf of the Americans that are behind enemy lines tonight? We have 15 seconds.
Donald Trump: (36:09)
Well, I would, but they’re not into words, they’re into strength. And the strength is the President because he controls … I rebuilt the military. We had an obsolete military. We had old jets, we had 45-year-old jets. We rebuilt this military and created Space Force. But the answer is I’d like to help, but you have to do it through the strength of the President’s office and Biden has dissipated that strength. We are no longer respected.
Sean Hannity: (36:38)
We’re out of time, sir. Thank you for your time. We’ll have you back soon. We appreciate you being with us. Laura is going to have a great show next. Don’t miss it straight ahead.

			Donald Trump: (03:17)
Thank you very much, thank you. And thank you to Charlie for that introduction, which was so beautiful and for your fearless leadership of Turning Point Action and Turning Point USA. Thank you, Charlie, very much. Let me also express my incredible appreciation to the thousands of bold, young, and proud American patriots that are with us today. What a crowd. What a crowd. And you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It’s about 110 degrees or something. That’s an incredible group. Thank you. Thank you to the people outside. We love you. You are the pulse of our movement, so true, and you are the ones who will make America great again. I started saying make America great again, again, think of that. Think about that because nobody’s done what we did in four years, the greatest economy, we will be talking about it. We have plenty of time. Does everybody have some time?
Donald Trump: (04:42)
I said, “I look forward to this speech.” They said, “Oh good.” I said, “How long a flight is it?” “About five and a half hours?” So I said, “Oh, can we maybe do it by Zoom?” But Zoom will never replace the real thing. Do we agree? Especially for our great young students, it cannot replace being in the classroom, can it? With your help, we will stand up for democracy and for justice. We will fight for truth, transparency and accountability, and we will not stop until we have restored our American birthright of honest, free, and fair elections. We’re gathered here in Phoenix to show our support for election integrity and for the brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona state Senate. Thank you. You created a movement all over the country. This is now starting all over the country. I’m hearing Texas wants to do a forensic audit, I just heard. Even though I won Texas by a lot, I said, “You should do it because you’ll find out what’s going on in this country.” It’s crazy. When you hear defund the police, when you hear no IDs… Of course, now they’re trying to get into the, “We never really said that.” It’s crazy. But when you hear open borders, how about open borders? All this stuff.
Donald Trump: (06:20)
In my opinion, there is no way they win elections without cheating. There’s no way. There’s no way. No second amendment. They’re against energy. We were energy independent two months ago, energy independent. Now we’re not energy independent. I saw where they’re negotiating now with OPEC again. Here we go again to negotiate. They are negotiating right now with OPEC and with Russia. We had so much oil. We didn’t know what the hell to do with it. It’s not even believable. They closed up so many sites. Today I want to send our profound and everlasting gratitude to every Arizona Republican who had the fortitude and the backbone to defy the lying media. Look at that. That’s a lot of media. A lot of media. See the red lights are starting to go off now. They’re going, “Cut. Cut. He’s at it again. He’s talking about the media.” It’s easy. Hey look. Some of them are down almost 80%. Can you believe it?
Donald Trump: (07:38)
And that’s because they lose credibility, but I want to just finish it. We want to demand a full forensic audit of the results of Maricopa county. I particularly want to thank Arizona Senate president, Karen Fan. She’s been great, she’s been strong. And I predict when the votes come in and that’s her in the Senate, I think they’re going to be so horrible that she’s going to go three steps further than she ever thought she’d have to because they will be in my opinion, and again, I’m not involved. They’re involved. This is the Arizona state Senate. I think the results will be so outrageous. You’ve already seen some of them come that they’re going to go many steps further than they would have. Judiciary committee chairman Warren Peterson. Where’s Warren? Thank you, Warren. Thank you, Warren. He’s here someplace. Thank you, Warren. We did win. We really did. Not me. We all won. We won. Everybody.
Donald Trump: (08:49)
When you looked at election night, we were up by so much. It was over at 10 o’clock and then all of a sudden they close the tabulation areas. They closed everything and we wake up and all of a sudden it’s tied or we’re losing. And nobody believes that. They don’t believe it. I tell you right now, they don’t believe it. State senators, JD Mesnard, Kelly Townsend. Kelly, you’ve been so incredible. Kelly, JD, thank you. Where’s Kelly? Kelly, thank you. Great job. Tremendous courage, you have. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it really a lot. Nancy Bartow. Nancy, wherever you may be. Nancy, thank you. Thank you very much. Great job. Thanks, Nancy. Nice to meet you. See, they all think I’m involved. I’m not involved. These are people that did this by themselves. They wanted to do it. They had to do it. They saw what was going on and they did it. So I’m meeting some of you for the first time. Senator Kerr, where Senator Kerr? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Somebody who’s been a warrior again. I don’t know him. Sonny Borelli, he’s great. Where’s Sonny? There he is.
Donald Trump: (10:13)
I recognize that man from television, but I don’t know Sonny. But Sonny, you’re really an amazing guy and a brave guy and a strong smart guy. Thank you very much. All of you. Vince leech. Where’s Vince? Thank you, Vince. Thank you. Thank you very much, Vince. Great job. Somebody else who’s really been out there that’s been a brave who wants to go many steps further than anybody, Wendy Rogers. Thank you, Wendy. Great job. You knew the answer early on when they were waiting for results, but you knew the answer. And I think Kelly Townsend is around someplace, where’s Kelly? Good. Okay. I didn’t see you in the audience now. I want it. Okay. And by the way, Kelly has to get a special… Really great. Wendy, Kelly, Borrelli, what a group. I wouldn’t want to fight. I wouldn’t want to fight you. Thank you. I like that. Wendy. We just have a new one, Wendy, Kelly, and Borelli that’s going to be a very famous… That’s going to be a very famous someday, I suspect. Good. Great to meet you. Great. Republican party chairwoman, somebody that has tremendous courage I will tell you. Somebody that’s been fighting so long and so hard and she never stops. And some people love her. And some people don’t like her as much. I happen to love her, but she is. She’s really a fighter. And she fights your governor who doesn’t do a damn thing. She’s fighting. He doesn’t do a damn thing. Chairwoman Kelly Ward. Kelly? I called up Kelly recently. I said, “Why wouldn’t the governor want an audit?” Maybe everything will prove to be correct, which we know won’t happen. I said, “Why wouldn’t this governor Doug Ducey…” When I did rallies, he always wanted to be in the front row. “Sir, could you mention my name please?” I’ll mention. And I did these rallies and he wasn’t very popular, but he won by a lot because he ran against a very defective candidate, which they found out after they nominated that Democrat. But I’d introduce him and I wouldn’t get much of an applause and I’d get a lot of boos. And I kept saying, “This guy’s not very popular.” But now you know what? He’s not popular with me either.
Donald Trump: (13:24)
They came to see me. They said, “Sir, would you like him to run for the Senate?” I said, “He’s not getting my endorsement. I can tell you.” The Mitch McConnell, there’s another beauty. The Mitch McConnell Republican. The Mitch McConnell. The old Crow. He was losing his election in the… I’ll tell you, Kentucky is a great place. I love Kentucky. They love me and I love them and I was way up and he was losing by two points. And he said, “Sir, I’d like to see you.” He comes over. “Would you give me a big endorsement? And could you do a television commercial?” And I didn’t love the idea because I’m not too high on him, but it was between him or a woman named Amy McGrath, a Democrat. She had 93 million sitting in the bank and he was two down and he was going to get blown away and I endorsed him and he went up 20 points, 20. She didn’t even spend her money. She had no chance because of my endorsement he went up 20 points and then he got up and said the nastiest things about me. That’s the way politics is, I guess. Sonny, it’s not that way in Arizona is it? Oh yeah.
Donald Trump: (14:38)
I think it is, Kelly. I think it is. No, it’s not as bad. That was amazing. You endorse somebody, you help somebody. I don’t want any praise. I don’t want anything, but I don’t want to have that kind of a thing happen. So it’s one of those things. But what you’re doing here is incredible as everyone here fully understands. The 2020 election was a total disgrace. It was the most corrupt.
Donald Trump: (15:23)
And I tell this to people. I tell it to Republicans and a lot of them are very good people and they say, “Well, sir, we have to get onto the future.” Let me tell you, you’re not going to have a future. First of all, our nation is being destroyed, but you’re not going to have a future in ’22 or ’24 if you don’t find out how they cheated with hundreds of thousands and even millions of votes, because you won’t win anything. You won’t win anything. And I tell Republicans, I say, “You don’t realize,” because some of them they’re good meaning, really a lot of them, most of them. We have certain people that are not good. They don’t have the Mitt Romney’s the little Ben Sasse’s of the world. They don’t have… I could name a few of them.
Donald Trump: (16:11)
Little Ben Sasse. “Could I have your endorsement?” Yes. The day after he won, he goes and starts going after Trump. But you know what? That’s the way it is. But you know, I tell people, this is the biggest issue there is. This is bigger than the border. This is bigger than anything. This is the biggest issue. And I see it just here and I’d say I’d make a speech. And I talk about the border because we straightened out the border. We had the strongest border in history. We straightened out the border and that’s a big deal. But when you look at all of the death and destruction that this election has caused and wait til you see what’s happening with inflation. Wait til you see the real numbers on inflation and what’s going on. And wait til you go to the pump today and you see $3.75 cents. We were at a $1.87 for a gallon of gasoline. It was the most corrupt, dishonest, and unfair election in the history of our country. The Democrats know it. The corrupt media, right back there a lot of people, they know it.
Donald Trump: (17:17)
Big tech knows it. And most importantly, we, the American people know it. We know it. But because of the steadfast conservatives all across our nation and that’s really happening now. If you look at what’s going on all across. They’ve come from so many different states to look at your audit procedures that they go back and I’ll call them and say, “How did you like it? What did you think?” They said, “We don’t believe it.” And then they’re starting their own audits now. That’s what’s happening. They’re coming and looking. They’re looking at what Karen and Kelly… They’re looking what they all set up here and they can’t… Wendy, what you’ve done. Borelli, I love you. Borelli, you’re Italian. I hope you’re all Italian, Borelli? That’s why I get along. That’s why I like him. Good. He’s tough as nails too, but you know what?
Donald Trump: (18:10)
They’re coming in. They’re looking and they go back to their state and they say, “This is the most incredible thing that we’ve seen anytime.” Why wouldn’t somebody want election integrity? Why wouldn’t they want to know? And I would be very happy. It won’t happen, but I would be very happy if they did it and everything was perfect. But you’re not going to find that. In fact, the preliminary numbers are a total disaster and we’re going to go over those numbers. The facts are coming out. The truth is being uncovered and the crime of the century is being fully exposed. Thank you. With what inflation is doing to our country. The crime has never been higher than it is. Now you have in Chicago, hundreds of people are being shot every weekend in Afghanistan. We haven’t lost one soldier in Afghanistan for the last year and a half. In Chicago, they have 188 people shot over a weekend. Many of whom die. That’s worse than any war zone anywhere in the world. Chicago and New York, what’s happening in New York. The crime in New York. And Rudy Giuliani was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City, by the way.
Donald Trump: (20:05)
And they’re going after him because he understands it and they’re going after him. And he’s a true patriot. What they’re doing to Rudy is a disgrace. Greatest mayor and the greatest prosecutor. I mean, he was a crime fighter. He was a crime fighter, but this was the greatest mayor. And you know, if I would have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, it wouldn’t have meant as much. Now you realize what having a great mayor is all about because when you look at what the hell is happening to our cities, run by Democrats, all run by Democrats. There’s never been any… It’s a crime wave the likes of which we’ve never seen before. It’s scary. People are afraid to walk down to the streets of New York and nobody gets prosecuted except Republicans, by the way. In every fake news story about the election, they always begin by stating that claims are unproven.
Donald Trump: (20:59)
There’s the fake news. Those claims are unproven. Do you ever notice, you read a story and you’re reading about massive fraud, but they don’t write about that too much. The biggest thing is they don’t write… But they always say, “While this is totally unproven.” And you’re saying, “Well, wait a minute, we caught thousands and hundreds of thousands of people.” And then they go, “While there is no evidence,” they have these little soundbites. But the craziest of them all is and always done in unison because you know, they work together. If this were a business they would be put in jail because it would be called a monopoly. But the biggest and the craziest of the big lie, they call it. You know, what’s the big lie? The opposite is the big lie. The election was the big lie.
Donald Trump: (21:45)
And I’ve got to tell you, I’ve got to say this. I’ve never said it before, but I’ve always thought it. If I lost the election, I’m okay with that. I’m okay with it. Seriously. If we lost the election, we lose an election. I’ll go home. I’ll start building buildings. I’ll do something. I’ll keep myself busy. But you know what? If we lost the election, we know when we lose. In Georgia, they had an election. We did so well. And everyone knew we won by hundreds of thousands and they stole it from us. And what happened is we had two senators running a couple of months later and you know what happened to them? The Republicans said, “We’re not going out to vote because this is rigged. This election was rigged,” and they know it. You know when you win and when you lose. If I lost this election, I could handle it pretty easily. When they steal it from you and rig it, that’s not easy. And we have to fight. We have no choice. We have to fight.
Donald Trump: (22:59)
And it starts right here with the amazing patriots in Arizona. And you’re proving the fake news media wrong. You’re proving them wrong because the evidence is monumental, just like Russia, Russia, Russia. Remember people would come up to me during the campaign, the first campaign and they said, “Sir, you know what I think about Russia?” “No why do you ask?” Just curious. There was these rumors. Another one would come up a month later, “Sir, do you have anything to do with Russia?” “No, I never even thought of it.” But after I got asked that question four or five times, I said, “What the hell is going on with the Russia?” And it was a fake deal made up by Hillary Clinton with a fake dossier where they pay.
Donald Trump: (23:58)
They play a different game. But you know, ultimately we’re much bigger than them. We have many more people because when you go over their policies, the fact is those policies are not a 50% of the vote. We have many, many more people. They’re tough, they’re mean, and they stick together. They do stick together. But their policies are so bad. They’re so pathetic. If they ever had our policies, maybe there’d be no Republican party, I must be honest with you, because we haven’t until now. And it started with these incredible people, many of whom are sitting right here. The state senators from Arizona, it started with them. And now it’s turning out to be a revolution in this country because people are saying, even some Democrats, they’re saying no. Knowing what happened in the election is a good thing, not a bad thing. It’s a good thing. And what are they trying to hide? Why wouldn’t they want it? Now they’re trying to hide at… That’s why I don’t understand guys like Ducey and your commissioners. These commissioners, they’re so bad.
Donald Trump: (25:10)
But you know, you have the witch hunt. Remember the great witch hunt and the impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two. And it shows you how the Republicans can really stick together. We have great Republicans. You have Jim Jordan. I’m going to get in trouble, but you have Jim Jordan and Devin. And by the way, you have three of them here tonight. These guys I’m going to… I hope you love them all because those three are fighters. But we’ll introduce them in a second. They’ve already probably spoken. I hope they have. That way they won’t take up any of our time. But they’re great. Here’s just some of the shocking information the auditors in Arizona have already reported. So this is reported. This isn’t coming from Trump. This has been reported. More than 74,000. Now I lost by about 10,000.
Donald Trump: (26:05)
We didn’t lose. We won by a lot. But they say we lost. So we need more than 10. So here we go. And we have numerous categories, almost all of which are much more than we would need to win the election. And again, remember the word determinative. If I lost by 10 and we found out that there were only two dead people, okay. But there weren’t. There were thousands and thousands of dead people that voted in different states, thousands and thousands. Some even applied for an application to vote. Do you believe that? So not only did they vote, they applied for an application, but if had two dead people and we lost by 10,000, I don’t consider that. I don’t. I only talk when it’s much more than you need. So think of this. 74,000 mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent.
Donald Trump: (26:58)
Other than that, it was very good. There’s no record of them being sent, but they were counted. So nobody knows where the hell are they, but we counter. The county has refused to disclose how many of these 74,000 were in person, early votes. And how many were magically appearing in a mail-in ballot box near you? How about those boxes? How about those boxes? How about those boxes where they were coming in and Biden was getting 97% of the vote? No, I don’t think so. In all fairness, we’d come…. We came for rallies here. We had 42,000 and 44,000 and he came and he couldn’t fill the eight circles. They had to use the fake news. No, they were calling the news. “Please, would you please stand over here please?” They’re getting newspaper reporters and reporters to stand there. They’re standing with cameras. They couldn’t fill the eight circles. The only thing I liked about his campaign, because he didn’t really campaign, the cabal campaign. Lots of people campaigned for him. But I did like the-
Donald Trump: (28:02)
… pay for. But I did like the, the contractor, and it wasn’t Hunter Biden with his artistry. Think of that. No, the contractor, those circles were so beautiful the way they were done. I’m very good at building buildings and painting and all these different things. So painting, I know what a good paint job is, and you’re not getting it from Hunter. But no, no, it was so professionally done. It was incredible. So good. In fact, I probably won’t do it yet, but at some point I’m going to find out the name of the contractor that did those circles, because I want to use them for some. But what about Hunter Biden getting a half a million dollars per painting, and he never painted before? Could you imagine if my kids did that? Could you imagine? And now they’re justifying it. “Well, we want to make it non-transparent.” No, actually you should make it transparent, I guess. But actually you shouldn’t make it real because it’s a bribe. It’s a bribe, a hundred percent bribe.
Donald Trump: (29:06)
You have good painters. For $250, you can have a portrait done on Central Park. Guys with pencils. They do so incredible. They’re geniuses. They’re just geniuses. You go to Central Park, and they have all these artists lined up. You negotiate a deal, they’ll do it for $250. They’re unbelievably talent. Some of them are beyond belief, what they can do in a short period of time. Hunter Biden’s getting $500, 000. It’s a bribe. It’s disgraceful, and the fake news media is talking about it like it’s okay, but we should have transparency. It’s unbelievable.
Donald Trump: (29:45)
And the laptop and the laptop, I miss you too. And the laptop from hell, it’s a laptop from hell. When you look at that laptop, people are writing about it. Meaning a very tiny group of people are writing. Some books are coming out. Some books by some very good people. But you know what? When you look at the laptop from hell, and then you watch the interview. It was Russia that did his laptop. Then they say, “Was it Russia?” Well, it may have been me. It may have been them. I think that’s the end of that one.
Donald Trump: (30:16)
It’s always Russia. You ever notice? It’s never China. Because they’re all getting rich from China. They’re not getting rich from Russia. It’s always Russia, Russia, Russia did it. Russia. Russia did it again. No, it’s a disgrace. By the way, I stopped their pipeline. It was stopped. They have a pipeline going into Germany, going into Europe. I stopped it. I put sanctions on all these states and all of these companies who were building it. Biden approved it. Then as you know, you’ve heard this before he stopped the Keystone XL pipeline. The real number is 48, not eight. They said 8,000, 48,000 jobs. And they lost all over the country. People sold their home. They were so excited that we’re going to be building this pipeline. Environmentally much better than a truck. Much better, frankly, than a train, a railroad, much safer. They were building it, and he stopped it like in the first week he stopped it.
Donald Trump: (31:15)
Yet he approves the biggest pipeline in the world, going from Russia to Germany. And we’re supposed to protect Germany. I said that. I said, “By the way, you would have never even heard about that pipeline if it wasn’t for me.” North Stream two, North Stream. Nobody ever heard of that. Nobody ever talked about it until I came along. Nobody did. Look, I get along with Putin because that’s a good thing. I got along with him. He got along with me, but nobody was ever tougher on Russia that I was. This pipeline is the biggest thing they’ve ever done. This is billions and billions.
Donald Trump: (31:48)
I asked Angela, and I get along with Angela too, but she’s doing what she’s doing for Germany. Although I think the pipeline’s a big mistake for Germany because they might as well just wave the red flag or the white flag because it’s over. It’s over. They’re going to get 60, 70% of their energy from Russia. So I said, “So let me ask you, so we’re spending billions of dollars to protect you from Russia. And you’re paying billions and billions of dollars for energy to Russia. What the hell is that all about?” Right? So I stopped it and within a couple of weeks he approved it, and now they’re going to be restarting it. They’ll have it finished in a couple of months and they’re going to make billions and billions of dollars, but the American pipeline is stopped.
Donald Trump: (32:33)
And I can only say that’s called America first versus America last. Look, they are destroying our country. If the election were the way it were, and let’s say they were doing a great job, number one, you probably wouldn’t be as enthusiastic. Let’s say they were doing a great job. By the way, your Arizona border, which I put up the wall. It was great. It was the best it ever was. And now what’s pouring into your state is not even to be believed. You know what? If instead of doing the harbor.
Donald Trump: (33:15)
They’re saying it was the worst six months in the history of the presidency. I don’t know that that’s true, but I would say it is. If you look at what’s happened to the economy. How about the vaccine? I came up with the vaccine. They said it would take three to five years, going to save the world. I recommend you take it. But I also believe in your freedoms a hundred percent. But just so you understand, but it was a great achievement. But then, and we started. We’re doing a million people a day, and then they said, “We’re going to put a pause on one of the vaccines.” What that did, that set it back so badly. And so now they’re saying what a wonderful job he did.
Donald Trump: (33:54)
They don’t say it too much anymore with respect to giving the vaccine. Now it’s turning out that they can’t say that anymore. And what they’ve done is because they don’t trust the president, people aren’t doing it. And that’s as simple as it can be. We did such an incredible job with COVID, with getting the gowns, the supplies, the ventilators, the masks, everything, and the press did nothing but kill us. They would say, “Look how well India’s doing compared to the United States.” How’s India doing? How is India doing? India is going through hell. They said, “Look how well South Korea is doing.” They would always try and pick the best country anywhere in the world that had the least problem. Those countries now are being ravaged by this plague that was sent to us by China. And by the way, China has to pay us retribution.
Donald Trump: (34:58)
All right. There were nearly 4,000 people who voted with a registration date after the cutoff on October 15th. So you have a cutoff, a legal cutoff, but thousands of people voted, and that’s illegal. Why did 4,000 people vote? Additionally, there were more than 11,000 individuals who were not on the voter rolls the day after the election. Think of that. They weren’t on the voter rolls the day after the election. ut who were on the list of voters that was published one month after the election. So they weren’t there for the election, but a month later they happened to find them, okay? This alone is more than the supposed margin that you needed. It’s 10,457 votes. We beat it in every category. There were 18,000 people who voted in Arizona in 2020, who were then purged from the rolls immediately after the election. Why didn’t they purge them before, Sonny? Could I ask you that question? Sonny said they cheated. They cheated. They cheated.
Donald Trump: (36:10)
We’re becoming like a third world nation, and it’s happening. Then 168,000 ballots were found to be printed on unofficial, very thin, flimsy paper. In other words, sounds to me like they were short of ballots, and they just made them up because you have what’s called quote “Voter secure paper.” It’s very heavy. It’s like the dollar bill. It’s very complex stuff. But they didn’t have that. So they had 168,000 votes and that’s required. It’s required. You have to have it. And they found it on paper. And the reason they noticed it, I guess, number one, it was very light, but they saw that when you hit it with a certain pen, it went right through the paper. They say, “What the kind of papers is this?” that’s 168,000 votes. And so that also would have been invalidated. They wouldn’t have allowed it to be on election day. They wouldn’t have allowed it. 168,000 votes. I wonder who they voted for. Tell me, I wonder who they voted for. Would you say it was a hundred percent for Biden or 97%?
Donald Trump: (37:19)
It was also revealed in a recent hearing that there are thousands and thousands of duplicated ballots that do not have a serial number, suggesting that votes may have been fraudulently duplicated and counted multiple times. Time after time after time. You saw it in Georgia, you saw those people go in. They said, “There’s a water main break. Everybody leave, everybody leave.” Everybody got the hell out. They don’t want to drown. They don’t want a water main break. And a short while later, a woman, a political operative, we all know her name. We all know her name, and it should have been taken care of, which should have been taken care of. But a woman comes in, but it is now it’s in court, and it’s a big deal. She came in with a group. She didn’t go back to her machine.
Donald Trump: (38:05)
They went for the table. They lifted up the skirt of the table, and lo and behold, it was loaded up with ballots, but they weren’t ballots that were in boxes that ballots come. They were in other, whether it was suitcases. It was totally different. They took those, and they started putting them in. Sometimes three times, sometimes five times. And they stood there. And I tell you what, when people looked at that they got sick. People threw up looking at it, and law enforcement did very little, but now what’s happening is I believe the courts are going to do a lot. It’s a big deal going on. That was total criminal behavior.
Donald Trump: (38:47)
So you hear those hundreds of thousands of votes. We won the state of Arizona, and we won it decisively. And we won other of these states. Isn’t it amazing? Barack Hussein Obama. He beat Biden all over the country decisively. So did Hillary, except in five swing states where Biden wiped him out with the black population. So I think that he’s not going to beat Obama, but only of these states. So he did poorly, except in these states, he had massive victories. We are really smart people. We can’t let this happen. We can’t let this happen.
Donald Trump: (39:35)
Yet this is only the beginning of the irregularities the Arizona audit is an uncovering. The authors and the auditors have collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers lowered signature matching standards from 20 points of comparison to 10, to five, and eventually down to zero. In other words, they abolished all signature matching entirely. In other words, you have a bad signature. So the machine was picking up a lot of bad signatures. They said, “This is no good. Let’s lower it. Let’s lower it.” They brought it down to zero. So you had no signature matching. Perhaps. This is why the county has refused to comply with an official subpoena sent out by your great senate to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they counted ballots and whether or not they had signatures at all. Because we think many of them had no signature at all because you can’t sign them all during the night.
Donald Trump: (40:35)
We think they didn’t, and you know what else they didn’t have? They didn’t have folds. In order to have a ballot counted, it has to be folded. But so many of these pages are laying flat without a crease, without a fold. Cyber security experts have also testified that the logs for the election management system software were wiped under highly suspicious circumstances. This is them saying it, not me. With more than 37,000 requests made to the server in a single day. Think of that. Erasing the data permanently for the entire period surrounding the election. Gee, I wonder why they erased the data surrounding the election? I wonder why.
Donald Trump: (41:17)
The county has, for whatever reason, also refused to produce the network routers. We want the routers, Sonny, Wendy, we got to get those routers, please. The routers. Come on, Kelly, we can get those routers. Those routers. You know what? We’re so beyond the routers, there’s so many fraudulent votes without the routers. But if you got those routers, what that will show, and they don’t want to give up the routers. They don’t want to give them. They are fighting like hell. Why are these commissioners fighting not to give the routers? How simple could it be? That will tell the truth. What are they trying to hide? Unbelievably, the auditors have testified that the master database for the election management system, sorry to tell you, has been deleted. I wonder why it was deleted. I wonder, Sonny, why was it deleted, please? Meaning the main database for all of the election related data in Maricopa in 2020 has been illegally erased. It’s been erased.
Donald Trump: (42:21)
The county has also refused to provide the authority for the information. We want the information needed to access vote tabulation devices. To top it all off, they’ve refused to hand over the all-important chain of custody documentation for Maricopa County ballots. They don’t want to give it. Why don’t they want to give it? Why? I stand before you today to demand nothing less than full and complete cooperation from Maricopa County and from the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors who have fought your senate at every single turn. Incredibly. Why? Why? Why?
Donald Trump: (43:07)
Why are Republicans fighting it? All they have to do is hand it over, and they’re either going to be right. They’re not even saying they’re right. They just don’t want it. They don’t even say they’re right. I think they know a hell of a lot about what happened, but why don’t they want to do that? The citizens of Arizona, an incredible state that as you know, I won four years ago and I won it again. Somebody came in from a media group, a very good media group, actually, said, “What was the difference between 2016 and 2020?” I said, “Well, the difference was I actually did much better in 2020.” It’s true.
Donald Trump: (43:49)
We got 75 million votes. We got 12 million votes more. No president in history has ever gotten anywhere close to 12 million more votes. And that’s with them doing counting. So you can imagine what the real number is. Okay? Now you can imagine. Because the easiest way of cheating is to throw them away. That’s easier. The postmen don’t have to deliver them. The post office doesn’t have to deliver them. It’s a very Democrat group and why not? They have the greatest pension plan that anybody’s ever seen. Why not? And that’s okay. But you know, a lot of them didn’t go to their location and when they were signed, they didn’t get brought back. But when you think about it, and when you think about the corruptness, why don’t these people want to find out the truth? The citizens of America deserve answers.
Donald Trump: (44:35)
We’re talking about America. You know, we’re not talking about Arizona anymore. We’re talking about the United States of America because this has gone on. And I hate to say it, but this is because you’re really bad, but this has gone much worse in Detroit, Michigan, much worse. We have a bunch of RINO senators up there. The exact opposite. You have one or two. We have a whole bunch of them up there, but we have a bunch of RINO senators. This is not as bad anywhere near, in my opinion, as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. You take a look at Philadelphia. What they did to our poll watchers were incredible. We had poll watchers, nice people, great people. They love our country. They were Republican, but more than anything else, they want an honest count. They’d turn them in either way. They were physically thrown the hell out and they couldn’t get in for days.
Donald Trump: (45:27)
So during that period of time, vast numbers of things happen that are terrible. And not only did they throw them out, they boarded up the windows. So they couldn’t even see inside. Then we got a court order, and they wouldn’t obey the court order. And then they kept them 60 feet away. Do you know what 60 feet? That’s like me looking at a vote with the lady in the beautiful red dress right over there, right? That’s 60 feet. And I’m saying, “Oh gee, how’s that ballot? I’m 60 feet away.” They were threatened by thugs. In Georgia a a recent review of valid images has shown that the error rate in the hand audit of Atlanta’s Fulton County was a whopping 60%. Would you say that’s high? Including outright fabricated vote totals as well as obvious duplications of ballots amounting to potentially thousands and thousands of extra votes for Joe Biden. All of this is in addition to the recently discovered 35,000 illegal votes that were potentially cast by people who did not live in the county in which they voted. Minor detail. As well as 100,000 people who were purged from the Georgia rolls after the election. Think of this. I lost by like 11,000. 11,000. They have a 100,00 plus, they were purged. They were deleted after the election was over. Far exceeding the margin needed for a Republican presidential victory. That’s just that one item. That’s the only one, but we have many.
Donald Trump: (47:07)
In other words, it is determinative. It’s no wonder that Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are going absolutely crazy screaming about voting rights, ranting about democracy. They want democracy and resisting every effort to look into the massive fraud in 2020. Just so you understand, we talk about cancel culture. The biggest thing that they want canceled is they don’t want you talking about the election that just took place because they say, “Holy shit, they caught us. They caught us. They caught us.”
Donald Trump: (47:59)
We’ve seen it. It’s a scandal, the likes of which we’ve never had, but the only way you get away with a scandal is if they don’t talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it. But they’re going to have to. If your votes are like people are thinking they’re going to be, and when you get up and announce whatever it may be, it’s not going to be able. They’re not going to be able not to talk about it.
Donald Trump: (48:19)
The press is so dishonest. They don’t want to talk about it. But if you think about cancel. Everything about cancel culture, they want cancel culture. But what they don’t want to do is anything having to do with the 2020 election. They almost got away with it. They may have gotten away with it. We’re going to find out because something’s going to have to be done. But I don’t think so. I don’t think so. If somebody robs Tiffany, a beautiful jeweler, 57th and Fifth, good location, excellent location. And they steal the diamonds and then they get caught. They have to turn the diamonds back. It’s very simple. Amazing the way it works.
Donald Trump: (49:04)
I only wish that my friend Mike Pence had that additional courage to send the results back to the legislatures because it all happened so quickly. They schemed in this plan for four years, this all happened so quickly. If he would have sent it back to the legislature, somebody gave him bad advice. The great Thomas Jefferson, you know what happened? Georgia, they couldn’t count their votes accurately. Hear ye, hear ye, the great state of Georgia can not accurately count its votes. You know what Thomas Jefferson said? Long time ago, he said, “Then we will keep the votes from the great state of Georgia.” He didn’t say, we’re going to send it back. I’m saying, just send it back. Maybe it comes back. But when you have more votes in some places by a lot than you have voters, I think Mike would have had the right to say, “Excuse me, we have more votes than we have voters. If you don’t mind, please take a look at it.” Just a couple of the basics. Just a little basics. So I wish he did that. I wish he did that.
Donald Trump: (50:18)
The radical left Democrat communist party rigged and sold the election. And we caught them. The time to hold them responsible and fix this broken and corrupt system is not in 2022 where it may be just as corrupt. And if it is, you’re not going to win. Or in 2024, the time is right now here in Arizona. Right now, right now. And you know what? If you don’t get down to it and if you don’t find, I hate to say this because it’s terrible for our country. But you’re going to have Republicans that aren’t going to want to vote. They’re not going to want to work for Kelly. They’re not going to want to have to work for Wendy and for Borelli, Mister Italy, they’re not going to work for you. You know what they’re going to say? They’re going to say, “We’re not going to let it happen again.”
Donald Trump: (51:29)
And that’s what happened to the two senators. They’re not going to work for you. And you got to get going. It’s the most important issue. You got to get going. We don’t have the luxury to sit back and to wait until the next election. We don’t. So many people, and they’re such good, I said it before. “Sir, think to the future. You’re leading in the polls.” We just got back from CPAC. I was at 98% approval rating in the poll. 98%. Sonny, what am I here? I don’t know. You think we’re at 98? I want to find out. I don’t know, 98, 98. And they say, “Sir, you’re leading in the polls, sir. You’re way ahead of everybody. Run in ’24, sir, you’re going to win.” And I say, “Wait a minute, I just won six months ago.”
Donald Trump: (52:26)
The survival of our nation depends on holding these responsible. And we have to hold these responsible elections. We have to hold those that are responsible for the 2020 presidential elections scam. It was a scam, greatest crime in history, and we have to hold these people accountable. And hopefully, and I say this, and I have confidence in it. Hopefully your Attorney General Mark Brnovich, your state attorney general will take information. This incredible information given by these incredible warriors and patriots. He’s going to take it, and he’s going to do what everybody knows has to be done. If he doesn’t do that, it would be so sad. And your governor, Doug Ducey, he will be of no help to you. No help to you. It’s incredible. He doesn’t want to know the answer.
Donald Trump: (53:24)
But more is being found out and uncovered every single day. Not only in Arizona, but all over the country. Numbers like you wouldn’t believe. Just this month, the former US Attorney for Philadelphia, William McShade. Look, did you ever hear of him? William McSwain, who previously prosecuted much ballot stuffing, many cases in Philadelphia, published a stunning letter. And he did it, I think from the heart, stating that his office received allegations of large scale voter fraud. This is Philadelphia and election irregularities all over Philadelphia. Also one of the most corrupt places from a voter standpoint, another, along with Detroit and some others, one of the most corrupt places, but he found, and he wanted to investigate all of this. But the Attorney General Bill Barr ordered him to stand down, and McSwain wasn’t the only one. And McSwain is very angry about it.
Donald Trump: (54:32)
Then Bill Barr went out and said there was not fraud in the election of any consequence. Look at the numbers. I’m giving you today. Look at the numbers. And we need two large ones or three small ones. We have many, many to look at. But two large ones. In other words, we’re right there. So it is of consequence. It’s only because sadly, he just didn’t look for fraud. When that letter came out from McSwain, that was a sad day for this country, sad day. I was wondering because he was all excited. McSwain was all excited. He was going to go in there. Then one day it’s like somebody died. he was told not to do it.
Donald Trump: (55:16)
One day, I noticed that the fake news media was calling Bill Barr, a puppet of Donald Trump. And he wasn’t a puppet at all. They had a picture of him with strings where I was totally controlling him. Just not true. They were saying that Bill Barr, you have to go against him, Bill Barr. Then they started saying they were going to impeach him. And they’re what’s called playing the ref. You know what that is? They’re doing it with the Supreme Court too. They’re nasty. You see now again, they want to impeach Kavanaugh? Not that they want to impeach him. They want to scare the hell out of him so he votes along the liberal lines because if he votes along the liberal lines, they’re playing the ref better than the great Bobby Knight of Indiana ever played the ref. Remember with the chair? The this they said, “Bobby, Bobby, you’re not going to win that call-”
Donald Trump: (56:03)
Or this, they said, “Bobby, Bobby, you’re not going to win that call.” He said, “But I’m going to win the next one.” That’s what they’re doing. The great Bobby Knight, who was one of our great endorsements. I will tell you, when Bobby Knight endorsed Trump, Indiana, we were doing well there before, you had to see after. Bobby Knight, that’s a piece of work, but he said, “It may not work this time, but it’s going to work the next time.” And the refs were afraid to say anything. It’s true. That’s what they’re doing with our Supreme Court. They’re trying to scare Kavanaugh. They’re talking about an impeachment. I just saw it again this morning in the paper. They want to impeach Kavanaugh again. It’s not that they do. They want him to rule for them. And if he rules for them, they’re never going to impeach him.
Donald Trump: (56:43)
But if he rules against them, like he supposed to, because he is a conservative, but they also don’t want to have a packed court. So they’re saying we’re going to pack the courts. We’re going to pack the courts. And they did the same thing to Barr. They said, “Trump controls him.” As soon as I saw that, I said, “Here we go,” because how does he get out of that? Very simply, just do things like the vote wasn’t rigged. And he stopped them from doing it. And I’m so saddened by it. But I also understand it because nobody does it better than these crooked Democrats. Nobody does it better. So I don’t blame Barr. I don’t blame a lot of people, but they become weak and they become ineffective and they become frightened. Like it or not, we are becoming a communist country. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening.
Donald Trump: (57:40)
We are beyond socialism. When you have no press that you can talk to, that’s how a communist country begins. They have no press. We find things in Arizona, and other than a couple of great networks, we have no press. We have no voice. I only have voice because I get great ratings. Ultimately ratings are very important. But even those lights, they still have those lights going. That’s good. I’m very impressed. That’s good. Thank you. And if the Democrats get some of the things they currently want passed, including the election of Corrupt Politicians Act, an infrastructure, which isn’t infrastructure, it will get even worse. What they’re asking for is incredible. The Green New Deal, going to destroy our country, this Green New Deal. It’s green new bullshit. That’s what it is. It’s bullshit.
Donald Trump: (58:42)
No more windows in buildings because environment. I always did great with these buildings that the bigger the window, the better I did, the bigger those windows, I wanted floor to ceiling windows, but they say you can’t do that anymore. We don’t want any more windows. It’s going to be real hard to sell apartments, I think. We have a beautiful apartment, and for environmental reasons, we have not put windows in the building. Oh great. Well, that sounds good. These people are crazy. Whatever happened to cows, remember they were going to get rid of all the cows? They stopped that, people didn’t like that. Remember? You know why they were going to get rid of all the cows? People will be next. People will be in there.
Donald Trump: (59:20)
Sadly, even in many red states, the rhinos are letting the radical left have their way on everything. In fact, I have to say this, in many cases, these weak Republicans or rhinos, these weak Republicans are worse. They’re worse than Democrats. And you have a couple of examples right here in Arizona and don’t nod. And don’t say it because I don’t want to get you in trouble. Maybe you can convince them to do what’s right. But you have a couple of them right here in Arizona and nobody knows. And I’ll tell you what, they’re going to be defeated as sure as you’re sitting there, they’re going to be defeated in the primaries by real Republicans.
Donald Trump: (01:00:04)
And it’s not so far off. You have secretaries of state certified election results that were highly inaccurate. And even fraudulent they’re certifying elections where the numbers are fraudulent. You have poll watches, as I said, who were illegally blocked from vote counting in Philadelphia, Detroit, and many, many other cities. In certain areas, there were more votes than there were voters. Think of that one. That was so easy. You say all these different things. A lot of people talking about the machines, I say, you know what? Too complex, you don’t need them. It’s so many different forms. They cheated in so many different ways. You don’t have to get complex. You don’t have to be a great scientist from MIT. They cheated in so many different ways. People were caught on camera illegally running ballots multiple times through voting counting machines. And remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I’m the one trying to save American democracy. I’m trying to save it.
Donald Trump: (01:01:11)
Our country is being destroyed by people who have no right to destroy it. People that won an election illegally. People that should not have been elected. They lost in a landslide. Joe Biden and the radical Democrats are wrecking our nation. I don’t even believe it’s him. I honestly don’t believe. I don’t think Joe knows where the hell he is. I don’t think it’s him. Crime is surging. Inflation is soaring. The border is gone. We went from the strongest border ever to the weakest border ever. The border is non-existent. Illegal aliens are pouring in, in record numbers. Critical race theory is being forced into every facet of our society. Free speech is being crushed.
Donald Trump: (01:02:09)
Men are being allowed to compete in women’s sports. How do you like that? Think of that. How fair is it? Did you see the weightlifter? I hate to tell you this women, but he shattered your longstanding record. This guy gets up boom, boom, like a nine year record, sonny, a nine year record. Boom. Did he do it with one hand? It’s so unfair. It’s so unfair. So ridiculous. I’ll be honest though, look, we all like to win. If I were a coach, I’ll tell ya. I wouldn’t be talking to too many women as we know women. I’d be getting some of these people that they’re women. Somebody said that if LeBron James ever decided to get the operation, how would he be? How would he be on the court? And by the way, LeBron James, you can have him.
Donald Trump: (01:03:19)
Did you see the basketball ratings, which were terrible. But they went up after his team was defeated and that’s happening. It’s in sports and people don’t want to see it. They want to see athletes. They want to see competition. But the last thing they want to see is men competing in women’s sports. Because very soon, you’re not going to have women competing anymore. I hate to say it. I hate to say, you’re going to have a coach have a full team. And that team is going to win the national championship so easily, you’re not going to have women competing. They’re taking away your rights. That’s really a women’s rights movement. You can’t let that happen. And now they just allowed it to happen in the Olympics. The Olympics has gone bad too. Our infrastructure is being hacked by foreign countries left and right. Thousands of rockets are being fired at Israel. And Joe Biden is allowing America to be pushed around and laughed at all over the world. This didn’t happen when I was president. This didn’t happen when I was president. In addition to all of our work, to hold Democrats accountable for their election fraud, which is massive, we must fight harder than ever before to win a colossal victory for America first Republicans, next year we have to, but again, you have to solve this problem.
Donald Trump: (01:04:42)
We’re going to work our asses off. But you have to solve this problem. Have to solve this problem. We must reclaim the House. We must reclaim the Senate. State legislatures all over. We did so well last election. And governor’s mansions all across the nation. Last year, Republicans made massive gains. I got no credit from these people. None. I made 58 phone calls, 58. They’re called teleconference calls. Everybody I made it to did so great. I was responsible for getting these people elected. In the House, we were expected to lose 25 to 35 seats. And instead of losing 25 to 35 seats, we lost for the first time in many decades, zero seats.
Donald Trump: (01:05:36)
And in fact, we shockingly gained 16 seats. And in the Senate, without my involvement, it would right now be 60/40 with the Democrats in the lead. Nobody likes to talk about that. We had such an incredible evening in the election. We did so well in the election. They like to say, I’ll tell you, you had a gentleman here, a legislator here who said… Thank you. And I love you too. He said, “Sir, I was prepared to lose my election,” people that you know. I didn’t know him. I spoke to him for the first time. He said, “I was prepared to lose my election. Two months before, I was prepared. Then I went to one of your rallies. And I saw the level of enthusiasm with thousands of people unable to get in. 42,000 people, thousands unable to get in.
Donald Trump: (01:06:33)
I saw the enthusiasm, but I was very much prepared. I assumed I was going to lose. “He has been there for a long time. Then he said, “And then the night before the election, I walked outside with my wife. And there were all these Trump signs, Trump, Trump, all over the place. Elect Trump, Trump Pence. They had Trump Pence and Trump, but they had all of these signs and they had the American flag and everybody was going wild. I said ‘Darling, I think I’m going to win the election.’ And the next day, sir, I won the election and I won my district by a lot. And you lost my district. And there was no way that I got more votes than you. You got far more votes than I did, sir. There’s no way possible. And I said to my wife, ‘This election is rigged.'”
Donald Trump: (01:07:25)
And what the fake news goes around saying is the reason we did so well in legislatures, the reason we did so well in Congress with not any loss, but all of these gains, I guess it was 16. All of these gains and the Senate, we did very well. Even though Mitch McConnell shouldn’t have said, “We won’t give 25 cents more than $600.” And the other side said, “We’ll give you 2000.” Like it or not, that’s not good politics. And frankly, they were going to get it anyway. It was a disastrous thing. He did ads where he was in the ad and he’s not a popular guy. So we should have won those seats. But if you just forget those two seats, we would have been 60/40.
Donald Trump: (01:08:08)
And what they try and do is say, “Well, the reason we won all…” Didn’t we win every legislature in the country? “The reason we won is because the legislators were far more popular than Trump.” No, it’s not that, that’s why I tell you that rather long story, because we carried them in, but they didn’t give me and the presidency, they didn’t give us the votes. That’s all it is. It’s very simple. And they’re liars and they’re scoundrels. And they’re very bad and very dishonest, but that’s just the way it is. Right here in Arizona, we must fire one of the most extreme leftists in Congress, your radical Democrat Senator Mark Kelly.
Donald Trump: (01:08:55)
And it’s not that he’s leftist. It’s that he doesn’t care about the border. With all the time I spent winning the legal stuff, I think we had 11 lawsuits, we won them all, and then I could start. It would have been so much easier, but I never heard from him. He never said, “How can I help?” He couldn’t care less about your border and your border in Arizona is one big… We did such a great job, but he did absolutely nothing. Kelly has done nothing to protect your state. And if you look at the Biden border crisis and it is beyond a crisis, they’re saying, “Oh, don’t use the word crisis.” Well, now that’s like a nice word.
Donald Trump: (01:09:35)
He’s completely owned and controlled by Pelosi and Schumer. And the open border is left. Now, the socialist Democrats and communists are trying to include amnesty in their reconciliation bill, which would turbocharge the crisis and neither Mark Kelly, nor anybody on the democratic side… They’re all fake moderates. They’re fake. They say they don’t say a word about it. If this change isn’t made soon, Arizona will never be able to recover from what’s happening. You’re getting it worse than most because you’re on the border. So big on the border. Taking back america begins with kicking Mark Kelly the hell out of the United States Senate.
Donald Trump: (01:10:26)
With us today are a few of the Republican candidates running to beat Mark Kelly next year. And maybe if you’re around, stand up. Blake Masters, where is Blake? Blake, thank you. Thank you, Blake, good, you’re doing well. Jim Lehman, Jim. Thank you, Jim. Great job. Thank you, Jim. General Mick McGuire. General, thank you very much. Thank you, General. Also with us, are Arizona’s gubernatorial candidates, Matt Salmon. Hi Matt. Kari Lake. Whoa. Wow. This could be a big night for you. Thank you very much, Kari. Good job. Steve Gaynor. Steve. Thank you, Steve. And state treasurer Kimberly Yee. Thank you, Kimberley. I have to tell you, maybe the most pleasure I’ll get out of any introductions tonight because these guys are warriors. They are warriors. They love your state. They love this country. We’re thrilled to be joined by several of our really best people in Congress. They happen to reside in a place called Arizona. First of all, Andy Biggs, where is Andy? Warrior. You’re so lucky to have these three guys. There are no games with these three guys. Paul Gosar, Paul. Paul. Incredible. And a woman that I have fallen in love with and the first lady is very upset about it. She is incredible. What she did during the impeachment, especially the impeachment hoax number one, she made a name for herself. She didn’t do it for herself. She did it for this country. Debbie Lesko, Debbie.
Donald Trump: (01:13:15)
Great. Debbie. Those are three great people. I actually said, “Do we have our stars?” “Yes, sir. They here. They wouldn’t miss it.” But I appreciate it. You really are. You’re warriors and you love this country. Thank you. When we win giant Republican victories and reclaim control over Congress and really reclaim it over our country, we will halt the radical Biden agenda in its tracks. By the way, remember, I used to say, it’s going to be worse? It’s not him. I really don’t believe. But remember I used to say it was going to be worse? Bernie Sanders can not believe what’s happening. He’s the happiest guy, he said, “I never knew this was going to happen.” Is that right, Paul? He said, “I never knew this was going to happen.” He can’t believe it. This is so much more radical. They never talked about this. They never talked about closing up the pipeline the following day. He talked about, “We’re going to study it. We’re going to look at it.”
Donald Trump: (01:14:11)
No, he did that, got some votes and he closed it. And how about the union on the Keystone pipeline? How about the union where they endorsed Biden? And I said, “You know you’re going to get screwed,” but they’ve always been with Democrats, but you know what? The voters are with me. The voters are with me and the workers. The workers are with me and with us, we’ll stop the federal takeover of elections and stop the Democrat attack on voter ID. Did you see the disinformation campaign? So they do a poll the other day and it showed voter ID, Andy, is it 88%, including Democrats, it’s 88%. Everybody wants voter ID. Who doesn’t want it? You go to the grocery store, you give a picture, do anything you do. You give a picture. Voter ID is at 88%. So here’s their line, all of a sudden, we don’t want a voter ID. Then one day they pass it on and the press plays along. We’ve always wanted voter ID. We’ve always wanted it. It’s the Republicans who don’t want it. Think of this.
Donald Trump: (01:15:17)
And they had the same thing with defund the police. We want to defund the police. We will defund the police. Now crime is at the highest it’s ever been in history. These police departments have been devastated. They have treated our great law enforcement, I just met a lot of them backstage, so badly with so little respect, but it’s a very unpopular thing. They didn’t know that. Who the hell wouldn’t know that? Defund the police. I’m telling you, they’ve got advantages, but they’re dumb in a lot of ways, their policy is so bad. So now they’re saying, you guys see that, “It was the Republicans that wanted to defund the police.” It’s just like Russia, Russia, Russia. They make up stuff. I watched that shifty shift go up to the microphone. ” It’s extremely important to save our country. President Trump is a paid employee of Russia.”
Donald Trump: (01:16:10)
It’s unbelievable. And you know what they say, if they say it over and over and over again, in a year from now, a lot of people are not going to remember who wanted to defend the police and who did it. And they’re not going to remember about voter ID, Andy. And we got to be careful with that. Paul, we got to be careful with that. Debbie, you’re not going to let that happen. You’re not going to let it, but that’s what they do. And you know what it’s called? Disinformation. They make up a lot of crap and they say it over and over and over. And one day you say, “Oh, who was the one that wanted to defund? I guess it was the Republicans.” The Republicans are against a very serious and a very sick enemy. We will end Joe Biden’s war on American energy and ensure that the United States remains the dominant energy superpower on earth. Can you imagine they’re out negotiated with OPEC again? We didn’t need OPEC. That’s why I was taking everybody out of the Middle East because we needed the Middle East for oil.
Donald Trump: (01:17:24)
Now we need the Middle East for oil again. We will break up the big tech monopolies. And we will immediately shut down Joe Biden’s border disaster. And we’re going to end, by the way, catch and release. I ended catch and release. You know what it is? You catch a criminal and you take his name or whoever, you take his name, her name, and you release them into our country. You release them. We did something slightly better. Stay in Mexico. We have stayed in Mexico. And we will restore our southern border. We want to remain, let them remain in Mexico. The people, they’re all over the United States, your border, and you’re getting hit hard, probably harder, much harder, but all over the country, you can go to Iowa. You can go to all over the country. They’re being hit and it’s a crime wave. Big crime wave is coming out of it. Go all over the country. And you’ll see you’re being hit. Right here in Arizona, Joe Biden has utterly demolished your border and cynically betrayed the people of the state because he never said he was going to do that. I told you he would. In May alone, border patrol encountered 540% more illegal migrants in the Tucson sector and 1500% more in Yuma than the same period when I was… Think of that, 1500% more in one year. Now that doesn’t mean as much as this for everyone you catch,, I think 10 come in. Some people say it’s five or six. Let’s say it’s 10. You’re talking about millions of people are coming into our country. We expedited removals and deported criminal aliens by the thousands. We took out MS-13 gang members by the tens of thousands, we got them out. Thousands and thousands of these absolute killers. And we built nearly 500 miles of beautiful border wall. The same wall that they wanted. I went with them.
Donald Trump: (01:19:36)
I said, “I don’t want the anti-climb paddle on top.” You know the paddle on top that you see? I said, “I don’t like it. I don’t want it.” They said, “Sir, it’s anti-climb.” I said, “Oh, in that case, I like it.” And they got to paint the wall, by the way, it sounds not so nice at a speech. How can Churchill make a great speech and say you got to paint the wall? It’s pretty basic. Remember what I used to say? There were two things that will never get obsolete. Everything’s obsolete. You have a new computer, three days later, you read it’s obsolete. Two things. What are the two things? The wheel and the wall. We achieved the most secure border in US history. Biden’s open border policies have blown it all up in shreds so fast. And they’ve enriched the drug cartels, the child smugglers, the woman’s smugglers, and the vicious MS-13 gang members. They are making more money with human trafficking now and drugs, the sale of drugs, we had fentanyl down to the lowest it’s been in 15 years because it’s not just people. It’s the drugs that come across. We had it to the lowest. This drug is a killer. A small amount can kill a thousand people. A little amount can kill thousands of people. We had it to the lowest level it’s been in 15 years and it was going down and now he blew the thing up. And I used to say, it’s incompetence, but they must really want this to happen. Why wouldn’t they have finished the wall? It would have taken two months. What are they doing? What are they doing? This is not just a national security crisis. It’s truly a humanitarian catastrophe. Last month alone, the remains of 43 people were tragically discovered along the Arizona border.
Donald Trump: (01:21:24)
Just your border. Nearly 100 migrant children were found stranded in the sweltering, Arizona desert, having been cruelly enticed to the United States by Biden’s rhetoric. He said, “Come in everybody, come in.” And they heard that and they all started walking up and I said, “You can’t come in. You’ll be stopped.” And we have 28,000 Mexican soldiers that are there. I said to the president of Mexico, who I like a lot, and he actually likes me. He’s from a different persuasion. He is a socialist, but he’s a great gentleman. And I said, “Mr. President, you’re going to have to stop them because we’re building the wall and they’re coming in.” And I worked out a deal. I said, “I will not put tariffs on the thousands and thousands of cars you send over on a daily basis, but you have to put 28,000 soldiers on our border free of charge.” And he said, “I will do that.” Now they’re gone. And now they’re all gone.
Donald Trump: (01:22:23)
And those soldiers knew what they were doing. I’ll be honest with you, there were no games. There were no games. We did a great job during the construction of the wall. Once the wall was up, you didn’t need them, but you have to finish the level empty areas of the wall. The flood of illegal immigrants is also placing a crushing burden on communities across the state and throughout the nation, depleting your already overcrowded schools and hospitals and public services of critical resources, you know that. They’re so crowded now because there’re so many people, many of them can’t speak English. The whole thing is a catastrophe. Your kids are saying, “What the hell is going on?” Even before the Biden border crisis, Arizona taxpayers were spending a staggering $2.3 billion a year to pay for the welfare education justice system, course and illegal immigration, $1,000 per Arizona household every year.
Donald Trump: (01:23:19)
And that’s now going to be doubled and tripled. In our movement, we believe that your taxpayer dollars should go to support truly needing Americans. You have to take care of American citizens. And look, we all have a heart. I see the same thing as you do, and we want to help people. But when you say, “Come up, come up, come to America,” our country can’t afford it. Our system is breaking down. We can’t afford it. You just can’t afford it. The whole world. This is in Mexico and Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador. They’re coming in from Yemen. They’re coming in from all over the Middle East. They’re coming in from Haiti. Large numbers are coming in from Haiti. They’re coming in from all parts of Africa.
Donald Trump: (01:24:03)
… numbers are coming in from Haiti. They’re coming in from all parts of Africa. They’re coming in from Europe, they’re coming in from all over the world. And our country’s not, no country is set for that. Number one, you can’t afford it. Number two, on a human basis and even on a common sense basis, it’s going to destroy it. They are destroying our country. They’re destroying our country.
Donald Trump: (01:24:21)
Under my Administration, America was respected again and respected like never before. We withdrew from the United Nations corrupt… We withdrew from the United Nations corrupt Human Rights Council. So corrupt, which seemingly existed to criticize Israel and the United States. That’s all they did was criticize us. But not only is Joe Biden, reentered the shameful and ridiculous international tribunal, but just this month you saw this, the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, sent them a pandering and very, very strange letter begging to United Nations to come and investigate America for its alleged systematic racism. So you have systemic racism. He says he wants it to be investigated. Systemic racism.
Donald Trump: (01:25:29)
I said, ” That didn’t happen. Did it?” I thought there’s nothing, it’s a joke about it. But I said, “That’s not serious, right?” Systemic racism, please come and investigate the United States. The Biden Administration’s action is an outrageous insult to the American people and to our country. The United States of America is the most just and virtuous nation in the world in the history of the world. And I’ll tell you, you’re not going to have a country very much longer. You’re not going to have a country. Always I talk about, we can do this, we can do that. Three and a half years is a long time. Two years is all they need. They’re going to knock out the filibuster, you watch. I used to tell Mitch McConnell, you know what? You better knock out the filibuster and get everything approved, because they’re going to do it. “They will never do that, sir.”
Donald Trump: (01:26:23)
Why won’t they do it? Because it’s bad for America. Do you think they care about America? They don’t care. And the first day they announced that they’re going to knock the hell out of it, you watch. The two senators are going to do a [inaudible 01:26:36] folder, and you’re going to have a big problem, especially in light of all of the disasters that Biden has caused. We shouldn’t be apologizing to the world. We’re apologizing for America, just like Obama apologized. Remember, he apologized. They should be apologizing to America for what they’ve done to it. That’s who I think should be apologizing to.
Donald Trump: (01:26:59)
The Biden Administrations, America last philosophy because it’s America last. It’s America last. That’s all it is, is also making a mockery of our country right here at home. Earlier this year, Biden signed an executive order pushing toxic, Critical Race Theory into our children’s schools and into our military. How about our military? This poisonous left wing doctrine is flagrant racism, plain and simple. And it has no place in our schools, no place in our military and no place in our country.
Donald Trump: (01:27:36)
You remember, I ended it very rapidly with a very powerful executive order, but that executive order was immediately repealed and terminated by the radical left. A Republican Congress will defund it and ban it once and for all. They’re going to ban it. They will get it done. In testimony before Congress, lightweight Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, actually defended the teaching of CRT, a Marxist ideology, to our men and women in uniform. Can you believe it? These soldiers, they’re the greatest. They’re hearing this stuff, they’re saying, “I can’t believe what I’m hearing.” The soldiers are saying it. He said he wanted to quote, understand white rage. He wants to understand white rage. What the hell is he talking about that for? Our generals should not be focused on learning left wing ideology. They should be focused on defeating America’s enemies and winning our future wars. Hopefully we don’t have them, but if we do, we have to win them.
Donald Trump: (01:28:41)
And I say it, and I’ll say it, whatever. The only reason I appointed Mark Milley in the first place is because two of the world’s most overrated generals, James Mattis and John Kelly could not stand him, had no respect for him and would not recommend him under any circumstances. They even tried to send him to Europe so he wouldn’t get the job. So when they didn’t like him, I said, “Let’s give this guy a shot.” Last summer, when rioters were threatening to destroy Washington, DC, Milley practically begged me not to send in the military to stop the destruction. I was thinking about it. It’s a big step to do it. Insurrection Act, big step to do it, but I was getting close, but he didn’t want to do it. He didn’t want to do that. Why would we ever want to do a thing like that? After walking, and I did plenty, I signed a executive order on statues. You knock down any of us statues, you go to jail for 10 years and it all stopped. It was a miracle. Right, Andy? It all stopped. Paul, that was great. We stopped it.
Donald Trump: (01:29:51)
When they were pulling down statues and then it got crazy. They start pulling down statues of Abraham Lincoln. It would have never stopped, but I signed that order. And as soon as I signed that order, not one event took place. You get 10 years for even attempting to take it down. All stopped, amazing. It’s amazing. After walking with me to the smoldering church, they tried to burn the church down the day before, the smoke was still coming out of it. Milley issued a groveling apology because he caved to the press. He was afraid of the press. And it was really in order to take off the pressure again, is what they do to these people is they come after them through the media, through every way they can. And they end up being weak people. All he had to do was say that I’m proud to walk with anyone representing the President of the United States, and people would have understood that. He apologized. And that was the end of him when he did that apology, that was the end of him, nothing to do with me. It’s the office that counts.
Donald Trump: (01:30:58)
As the radicalization campaign in our military illustrates. We are seeing almost every major institution in American life be taken over and weaponized by the extreme left, including law enforcement, the military, the corporate media. These people here just, you know, it’s just… I hope they’re, more than anybody in this room, I hope they are listening because they’re destroying our country. And especially the big tech companies, which are engaged in illegal censorship of the American people. It’s a first step to restoring free speech in our country. This month, as you probably read, I filed a major class action lawsuit suit against big tech [inaudible 01:31:42]. If you want to join, you can. We’re suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google in Federal Court. And we will keep on fighting until we’ve reclaimed the sacred right of freedom of speech for every single citizen of this nation.
Donald Trump: (01:31:59)
What they do to the conservative voice, and again, they say private, but they have Section 230, which basically gives them immunity, that gives them no problems at all. We don’t need lawyers. So once they do that, they have a right that nobody, Section 230, that no other company has anywhere in this country, so that no longer puts them in that category. And we can go after them and let’s see what happens. But far worse than even big tech is the lame stream media, which is no longer free. And with few exceptions is totally corrupt and is truly the enemy of the people. That’s all that you can say. You know that. And maybe I see it better because we can give them a statement that’s so accurate and so proven. And then they write it the opposite. Whereas if you’re a carpenter, you’re an electrician, you’re a worker, you’re a lawyer, whatever you might do, you don’t know that. You just think that what you’re reading, they have the lowest rating right now, approval rating, in history, in the history of the rating business. They have their lowest rating, because people have gotten wise to them.
Donald Trump: (01:33:08)
And I think it’s something that in terms of legacy, I’m very proud of what we’ve been able to do. I’m very proud of it. Nobody had any idea the level of deception and corruptness. The media doesn’t report the news anymore. They only report bad things about us and make it worse. They report bad things and they make it worse and good things about them and they make it much better. And they make it much better. If there’s anything bad about the other side, they never want to talk about it. Look at Hunter Biden. They don’t want to, you don’t see it. They don’t want to talk about it.
Donald Trump: (01:33:47)
Can you imagine if that were a Republican, if that were a conservative in some high level? As an example, the network nightly newscasts hardly ever discuss the crime rate, which is at an all time high. The disaster taking place at the border or Joe Biden’s very slow vaccine rollout is very slow, very slow. They actually tried to take credit for the vaccine and that didn’t work out too well.
Donald Trump: (01:34:12)
They don’t blame Biden for anything, including the fact that the virus is making an unexpected comeback and ravaging countries throughout the world. Only in a short time ago, it looked like it was going to be good, but nobody says it’s Biden, does anybody say it’s Biden’s fault? And I’m not even blaming him, but does anybody say it? Because the job we did was so incredible. That’s why we’re in the position we’re in today. So incredible. And that’s all they wanted to talk about. They wanted to demean and it was a disgrace. The radical left is determined to ruin everything in America. That’s what they are doing.
Donald Trump: (01:34:49)
Woke politics takes the life and joy out of everything. Woke-ism makes you lose, ruins your mind and ruins you as a person. You become warped. You become demented. The US Women’s Soccer team is a very good example of what’s going on. Earlier this week, they unexpectedly lost to Sweden, three to nothing, and Americans were happy about it. You proved that point before I even said it.
Donald Trump: (01:35:34)
Now the left is in the process of destroying our national pastime, baseball. First, we saw the embarrassing spectacle of the Commissioner of baseball, bowing to the radical left on voter fraud. You saw what they did. You saw they moved the All-Star game. Now one of the most beloved and storied franchises in baseball, all of baseball, I watched it as a kid at Yankee Stadium.
Donald Trump: (01:35:58)
The Cleveland Indians will be changing their name, a name that was filled with history and memories. The new name will be the Cleveland Guardians, which is terrible. The Cleveland Indians, if I were an Indian I’d sue. Sue them, Indians. I mean, what could be better? Especially if you have a good team, the Cleveland Indians, it’s one of the greatest names. One of the most incredible logos. People love it. They are going absolutely crazy in Ohio over the name change. The Cleveland Guardians, what’s that all about? The insanity of the left knows no bounds. And both Indians and baseball fan should be greatly insulted. They want to take away our history, our heritage, our culture, and everything that holds us together.
Donald Trump: (01:36:53)
By the way, remember when Bill Clinton was in Arizona, do you remember that? It was about 125 degrees out, sorry to bring that up. And he has a bad heart. And he said he was playing golf, but actually he was meeting on an airplane with the Attorney General discussing Hillary. I wonder what they were discussing. Remember he said, “No, no. I was only there, I was only there to discuss my grandchildren and golf.” Remember that? He said he was out there to play golf, but it was about 121 degrees that day, which is a little hot.
Donald Trump: (01:37:31)
What’s happening to our country has sadly happened to so many others. We are at the beginning of a communist system. Radicals are seizing power and destroying everything we hold dear as Americans and it’s happening. And I said it was going to happen. They dismantle the rule of law, censor speech, take over the free press, imprison political opponents. You see that’s happening all over. Look at what I’ve been through for years. And of course, hold fake, phony elections. It was recently revealed that during the hand recount in Fulton County, Joe Biden had batches of ballots go for him. 100 for Biden, nothing for Trump. I got nothing. I got nothing. Give me one vote. One vote.
Donald Trump: (01:38:22)
Even Fidel Castro only got 99%. Okay. So many of our state and local offices have been overtaken by corruption. The radical left install partisan Democrat prosecutors who are not interested in equal justice, but political justice. It’s happening at a level that we haven’t seen this happen in many, many years. They would wield law enforcement against political opponents, inventing that never had been prosecuted before, while murderers and criminals walk free without prosecution at all, all over the streets of our cities in particular. They’ve turned our cities into Banana Republics where the innocent are persecuted while crime soars.
Donald Trump: (01:39:10)
Just look at what they’ve done in New York city. Innocent people are beaten in the streets daily. People are shot in Times Square. Rapes and murders are totally out of control. And yet what are the leftists and the attorney general and district attorney’s offices working on so diligently? This is what they’re working on so diligently and with such passion, it’s get Trump. They campaign on getting Trump. Their campaign, we’re going to get Trump. We’re going to take down Trump. They don’t talk about the murderers. They don’t talk about no cash bail. They don’t talk about all these dangerous people walking the streets so people are afraid to come to New York.
Donald Trump: (01:39:56)
They’re still coming after me because I will never stop fighting and winning for you. Going through it for five years, five years. From the very beginning of our movement, we have been fighting against some of the most corrupt, powerful and entrenched forces imaginable. The professional political class, the deep state, the fake news media, the Russia hoaxers, the globalists, the socialists, the communists, the lobbyists, the corporate special interests who are absolutely terrible. And now the Critical Race Theorists, all of them oppose our movement for a simple reason. We believe in putting America first. It’s very simple. We believe in strong families, strong borders and strong sovereign nations. We believe in fair trade for the American worker. Look at what we did with the worst trade deal in the history of the world, NAFTA.
Donald Trump: (01:41:06)
Now we have the USMCA, and Mexico and Canada are not thrilled. That’s a good sign by the way, but it’s a great deal for us. And the stiff tariffs that I put on communist China, I tell you what, all they wanted to do is not have me put on tariffs. We were getting along absolutely great until COVID came. The China virus came, we were getting along great. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars from China in tariffs and what was happening, our farmers with the trade deal that I made with China were doing phenomenal. They are doing now phenomenally because China is buying numbers that nobody’s ever seen before, corn and soybeans, everything they are buying.
Donald Trump: (01:41:49)
But you know what? Once the virus came in, I didn’t even talk about that trade deal. It meant nothing to me. It meant nothing to me. So sad for what’s happened to our country. So said what happened to the world. So many people are dead and so seriously injured, and they’re going to have to pay. We believe in low taxes, low regulations, unleashing American energy independence, and putting, we have to have independence with our energy. Think of what they’re doing. Think of what they’re doing. Look at what’s happening at the pump. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. It’s going up at a record pace, and you’re going to be at $7 or $8 or $9 a gallon, and putting American jobs before the interests of foreign corporations. We believe in ending the endless foreign wars, rebuilding our military, supporting our warriors, taking care of our great veterans and bringing our troops back home, where they belong. Where they belong.
Donald Trump: (01:42:58)
And as you know, I started the move out of Afghanistan. I think it was impossible for him to stop it, but it was a much different deal. I told the Taliban, I spoke to the leader and I spoke. I said, let’s call him Muhammad. I said, “Muhammad, we’re leaving and we’re going to get along. But just in case, for any reason you decide to do something terrible to our country or beyond what’s normal,” because they’ve been fighting for a thousand years, “in your country, we are going to come back and we are going to hit you harder than any country has ever been hit.” And I told him that. This was a telephone conversation, had a number of them. I said, “We’re going to get along great, but I just have to make that statement. We’re going to hit you harder than any country.” And he’s a rough guy. This guy has been fighting from the time he’s two years old. That’s what they do. They fight. That’s what they do. They fight. Russia did very poorly against them. Russia is Russia now, not the Soviet Union because of Afghanistan. Afghanistan. So they fight. I said, “We’re going to come back and hit you harder. Do you understand?” He goes, “Huh?”
Donald Trump: (01:44:19)
He’s a rough guy. I started off the conversation. I said, “Muhammad, how are you? President Trump.”
Donald Trump: (01:44:26)
“Uh.” Not a lot of social grace, but he was being nice. I think he was being as nice as he could be, Andy, but they’re rough. That’s all they do is fight. But I said, “We’re going to come back and hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And your village, where I know you are and where you have everybody, that’s going to be the point at which the first bomb is dropped” I told him that, I told him.
Donald Trump: (01:44:59)
And he said to me, and I think he actually meant it. He said to me, “I understand. I understand.” And I believe beyond a deal, I believe we had a real understanding. And then we had the election rigged and stolen, and now they’re going wild over there. That would not have happened if I were President, would not have happened. Too bad. Too bad.
Donald Trump: (01:45:29)
We believe in patriotic education for our children. And we strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America’s youth. We’re not going to let it happen. We are committed to defending innocent life, protecting our constitution, and to proudly upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our nation’s founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctness. We don’t like political correctness. And we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture.
Donald Trump: (01:46:09)
We believe in law and order, and we respect and support the men and women of law enforcement, and above all we live by the words of our national motto and it will never ever change, In God We Trust. Sustained by these timeless American values and powered by the strength of these unstoppable ideas, we will press forward. We will have victory after victory. Never forget the heart, soul, brilliance, passion and patriotism of the young people here today. They’re young, great people. And Charlie, I want to thank you. What a joy you’ve done, what a job you’ve done.
Donald Trump: (01:47:17)
And to the devoted citizens all across our country, is so much greater than our opponents can even imagine. We are there. We have massive majorities and we’re much stronger than them, much stronger than them. We’re much stronger than they are, because unlike their agenda, our movement is not driven by the lust for control and domination of others. Our movement is driven by a love for America and an ironclad faith in the American people. I have that faith and you have that faith. We are not fighting for socialism, communism. We’re not fighting for servitude. We’re fighting for God, for country and we’re fighting for freedom. We know in our veins that our American inheritance was passed down to us by generations of patriots who gave everything they had, their sweat, their blood, and even their very lives to build America into the most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are not going to let it be taken away from us by a small group of radical left, Marxist maniacs.
Donald Trump: (01:48:45)
So my fellow Americans, our movement is the greatest in American history. There has never been a movement like we have had. We won the most important election, 2016. We did more than any other administration has ever done. And we did it quickly. We’re not going to let it be taken away from us.
Donald Trump: (01:49:15)
The 2022 midterms are the next phase of the battle and we will not stop there. We will keep on going until we have made America great again. With your help, we will take back the House. We will take back the Senate and we will take back that beautiful, gorgeous White House. And we will take back our country. So working together, we will make America powerful again. Thank you. Thank you. The whole country is watching, the whole country is watching what you have done. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you to Turning Point. Thank you.

			Donald Trump: (00:07)
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Audience: (00:18)
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
Donald Trump: (00:18)
Thank you very much. Thank you to Matt. What a job. He and Mercedes have done. CPAC is a hot item. You got a lot of people standing outside trying to get in. Would anybody like to give up their slot? Would anybody? I want to just pay my respects. CPAC is really, what a job they’ve done, and I’m thrilled to be back in the heart of Texas with the proud conservative patriots, who are courageously leading the battle to frankly save our country. That’s what it’s about.
Donald Trump: (00:52)
For a year before election, the fake news media said Texas was in play. It’s in play. You know what in play means? Like it’s close. And they were right, except it was totally in play for me. For me and you, actually. No, it was in play for me. They said, “The polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won Texas.” But how long did we listen to it? It was in play. it will never be in play if we have the right candidate. This state is never going to be in play. this is a very, very special place, and we’re going to keep it the way it is, and we’re going to bring back your energy.
Donald Trump: (01:31)
I told you this was going to happen. I told you. Actually, Texas believed us. With the help of everyone here today, we will defeat the radical left, the socialists, Marxists, and the critical race theorists. Whoever thought would be even using that term. We will secure our borders. We will stop left wing cancel culture. We will restore free speech and fair elections, and we will make America great again. It’s very simple. Very simple.
Donald Trump: (02:20)
From the very beginning, the people in this room have been some of the staunchest and fiercest supporters of our incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. And I can say that, and nobody ever even challenges me. Look at all those fake news people back there. They don’t challenge us. They don’t even challenge.
Donald Trump: (02:49)
I want to personally thank each and every one of you for your incredible support, and your support of CPAC. You never stopped fighting for me, and I will never, ever stop fighting for you. Promise. I especially want to thank two wonderful and really extraordinary people who make this incredible event possible. You know them almost as well as I do. Matt and Mercedes Schlapp. Thank you, thank you. Stand up, please. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Great job. You’ve taken it to a whole new level. I appreciate it. Everybody appreciates it.
Audience: (03:47)
Trump won! Trump won!
Donald Trump: (03:47)
Thank you. It’s true. We all won. We all won. Also with us is a true Texas conservative, and a real leader. Where is he? Ken Paxton. Where is he? Oh, look at that. And he is. He’s fast on the draw. We love Ken. Thank you, Ken, very much. We appreciate you being here. We’re also grateful to be joined-
Audience: (04:13)
[inaudible 00:04:13] USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. USA.
Donald Trump: (04:17)
He’s going back home to mom. His mom is a big supporter of ours, by the way. He’s going to have a rough night. We’re grateful to be joined as well by a wonderful, wonderful, not only political person, but a wonderful person, Governor Kristi Noem. Governor. Thank you, Kristi. Great job. And we have many, many members of Congress here. Could I ask our great Congress men and women to stand up please, right now? What a group. What a group. What a group. All warriors. Thank you very much. Thank you, fellows. Warriors. Truly are, they’re truly warriors.
Donald Trump: (05:24)
And countless other conservative leaders and politicians and people that we love and we respect, and we are fighting with and we are fighting for. For generations, the American conservative union has helped lead the charge to defend our values, protect our country, and preserve our glorious American heritage. You see they’re taking our heritage away. That’s not going to happen. Not going to happen.
Donald Trump: (05:50)
We were doing so well until the rigged election happened to come along. We were doing really well. But today that heritage is under threat like never before. Who would have thought this could have happened? Even Bernie Sanders is saying, “I never thought this could happen.” He’s mild by comparison. In a matter of mere months, Joe Biden has brought our country to the brink of ruin. Right here in Texas we are the epicenter of a border and migration crisis unlike anything anyone has ever seen before in the history of our country.
Donald Trump: (06:28)
At the same time, they have totally obliterated your energy industry. I told you. Under my administration, we achieved a historic reduction in illegal immigration. Never happened before to that extent, and not even close. We ended the horrible catch and release, where we catch a criminal and release him into our country. We actually said, “Nope, it’s called stay in Mexico.” And it worked very well, and we had the support of Mexico. Who else could do that? And you have a great president of Mexico, a friend of mine. He’s done a great job. We’re on opposite sides of the spectrum, but we got along great, and he’s been terrific, and I appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (07:16)
We stopped asylum fraud, and we struck critical agreements with other countries to stop illegal immigration. We called it, in fact, remain in Mexico. You don’t come here. Get released, and you never see these people again. They don’t come back. They say, “Come back in three years for a court case.” Only the really not smart ones. I want to be nice. Only the real not smart ones come back, which is about one percent.
Donald Trump: (07:46)
We reduced drugs pouring across our border by the highest percentage ever. History of our country. Not just people. We shut down the migrant caravans. You haven’t seen those caravans. Get ready, because they’re coming up right now. You’ve been watching them come through. In those caravans, you have some deadly people.
Donald Trump: (08:10)
We dealt a crippling blow to MS-13. We deported criminal aliens by the thousands and thousands and thousands, and we built almost 500 miles of border wall, the exact wall that the border patrol wanted. I thought we could use nice concrete plank. Just knock it out. They said, “Sir, we want steel, concrete, and rebar. And it has to be wired, sir. So we can all the drones the Democrat…” Remember they wanted drones? I said, “Drones are not going to stop people.” Do you remember the statement during the campaign? Two things. Everything’s obsolete like two days after they come up with it nowadays. Computers, everything obsolete. They got a better one.
Donald Trump: (08:55)
Two things, right? What are they? Wheels and walls. They never change. In a thousand years, you’ll say, “Wheels and walls.” Walls work. Walls work. Just ask Nancy Pelosi. She has a nice wall around her house. Now the Biden administration has turned the border into the single greatest disaster in American history, and perhaps in world history. Nobody’s ever seen a border like this. Other countries don’t have a border like this. Illegal border crossings are up over 1,000% from last year. Think of this. Think of this
Donald Trump: (09:34)
For the last three months in a row, more illegal alien minors have arrived than any other month in United States states history. This is the major pipeline for MS-13. These are the worst gang members, they say, anywhere in the world. They bring recruits to every state in our country. they run it like a business. But not with me. We were throwing them the hell out of here so fast. ICE, ICE. ICE, the great patriots. Tough people, ICE. And they’ve been disrespected. We can’t have them disrespected. Border patrol. Brandon’s here some place, probably. Where the hell is Brandon? He is so great. What a job he’s done. Yes, thank you. Thank you. ICE and border patrol.
Donald Trump: (10:26)
Overall, illegal youth arrives, and arrivals are up nearly 500%. Think of that, and they’re being resettled in cities and towns all across the United States at tax payers’ expense. And the people in those cities and towns have no idea that they’re coming. The tax payers will also be forced to pay for relatives to be flown from Central America to join them. Did you ever hear of chain migration? You come in illegally, and we’ll also bring your mother, your father, your grandparents, your brothers, your sisters, your aunts, your uncles. Anybody else want to come in? Come on in.
Donald Trump: (11:07)
We had on the West Side Highway. He was driving rapidly down the West Side Highway at a very excessive speed. New York City, Hudson River, beautiful new park. And he saw people working out. A big group of people, and he decided to make a right turn, and he killed many, and he maimed many. People go out because they want to put themselves in shape, and they end up going back home missing a leg, missing a couple of arms, or dead. That’s what happened. And he had the right to bring people in with him. His family, his mother and father, and his brother. And he had many that he brought in, but we took very good care of him.
Donald Trump: (11:52)
But this administration doesn’t do that. Many of these children, for the first time ever, it’s a terrible thing that’s happening to them, are on suicide watch. They end up in a place that they have no idea where it is. No idea. Not the border. Our whole country has become a border. Meanwhile, ICE removals are at the lowest level ever, and they are great people. They’re patriots and they’re tough. The agency has been functionally shut down. All of America’s now one giant sanctuary city. We were fighting sanctuary cities, and doing very well. They’re meant for criminal aliens. That’s what they’re meant for. Under our administration, we sent a very different message to the coyotes, human traffickers, child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and savage MS-13 gang members. When I was president, illegal alien criminals knew that if they trespassed across our border, they would be caught, they would be detained, and they would be sent to jail, or we would send them the hell back to where they came from. We created the most secure border in all of American history by far.
Donald Trump: (13:17)
Biden’s border crisis is also helping drive an unprecedented crime wave, and you see the crime wave. Even without this you see all in Democrat run cities. Please remember that. The bloodshed and violence in these cities is reaching epidemic proportions. Homicides are up 42% in Los Angeles, 37% in Philadelphia, 68% in Atlanta, and over 500% in Portland over this time last year. Think of that. Portland. What they did to Portland, and nothing happens to Antifa, and nothing happens to BLM. But to people that are patriots or conservatives or Republicans, they stay in jails for extended periods of time, and they destroy their lives. We’re not going to take it anymore.
Donald Trump: (14:26)
In New York City, crime is out of control. It’s at record levels with nobody being prosecuted except of course innocent Republicans are being prosecuted. The Democrats know their policies on crime are so unpopular, so radical, so crazy, they are now trying to pretend they never led the defund the police movement in the first place. Disinformation. “We never said defund the police. You know who did it? The Republicans did it.” That’s what they do. It’s called disinformation. How about Russia? “Trump had to do with Russia. He loves Russia. He loves Putin. He loves everybody.” Turned out to be the Democrats, right? After two years, they figured, gee. And after awhile, people actually believed this stuff. But now they’re saying, “Defund the police. We didn’t say it. It was the Republicans.” It’s called disinformation. You have to be wise to it.
Donald Trump: (15:23)
It’s very simple. If you support defunding the police, vote for the radical left Democrats, and you see what’s happening to the cities where they defunded the police. There’s never been anything like it. If you want more police and more cops on the streets, vote for America first Republicans or let’s put it very simply, vote for MAGA. Make America great again. MAGA. MAGA, MAGA, MAGA. The same far left Democrats who are defunding police are also leading an all out crusade to strip you, the law abiding citizens of America, of your God given Second Amendment rights. I told you again. I told you. I told you. And I preserved that right 100%, and you think that was easy? It wasn’t easy. There was so much pressure. There was so much pressure. Republicans must never waiver in demanding that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Can’t let it happen. Thank you. Thank you very much. But it’s not only the Second Amendment that the leftists want to destroy. They are hard at work to abolish the First Amendment as well. Probably all amendments, when you get right down to it. Why not? The radical left and big tech’s attack on free speech is unlawful. It’s unconstitutional, and it is completely un-American. To protect the Constitutional rights and liberties of every citizen, this week I filed a major class action. Lot of people are joining. Yep. A big class action lawsuit against the big tech giants. We are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google. And to show you the arrogance, I was just talking to Mercedes, I guess.
Donald Trump: (18:06)
Matt, you announced that they’re trying to take this incredible, I think much more than 50% of our country. I really do. Because there’s no way they can be 50% with defund the police, sanctuary cities. And all of the crazy things that they espouse. There’s now way. But I heard they just filed where they want to take everybody down. Honestly, they’re going too far. They’re going too far. They’re so spoiled. It’s like a spoiled child. “I want that toy, dad. But I also want this one, this one, this one.” Eventually bad things happened.
Donald Trump: (18:45)
We are taking Mark Zookerbucks, Jack Dorsey, and the other Silicon Valley billionaires to federal court, and we will keep on fighting until we have stopped this assault on our liberties and until we have restored the sacred right to freedom of speech for every single American. Who would have thought? Who would have thought? Who would have thought? Could anybody believe we’re even talking about this subject two years ago, three years ago? Who would have believed it?
Donald Trump: (19:29)
In addition to their malicious attacks on free speech, these Silicon Valley tyrants are also attacking our democracy itself. The big tech election interference in 2020 was an outrageous assault upon our Republic and upon the American voter. Terrible thing has happened to our country. We’re being laughed at all over the world. Our election has been studied by other countries. They’re not going to do it that way. Mark Zuckerberg alone spent $ 400 million dollars on election meddling. In virtually all of the key swing states, he funded unmanned and unprotected drop boxes that were deployed in Democrat run cities and heavily Democrat precincts to scoop up ballots which were supposedly 94, 95, 96% for Joe Biden, because he campaigned so well from his basement. How about where Biden did substantially better in the swing states than Barack Hussein Obama with the black population? Now, even though he did terribly throughout the country. But in those five places, he did very well. You know about that, Louie, right? He did five places, he did very well. Beat Obama with the black population. I don’t think so. But they practiced that and countless other schemes to illegitimately and illegally boost the Democrat vote. The drop boxes were often very late. Where are they? Where are they? What happened? They’re supposed to be here. They’re not. I can tell you what happened. Sometimes late by days in showing up to the vote counting areas.
Donald Trump: (21:18)
At the same time, the big tech giants worked together to suppress and diminish news coverage that was negative for Joe Biden. Look at all these stories that came up, and they were wiped out. Anything negative for Biden or the radical left Democrats, they just suppressed. And the most horrendous example, the oldest newspaper in America, and one of my favorites. It’s a great one. The New York Post broke one of the biggest scandals ever to emerge in a presidential election, providing extraordinarily detailed evidence of the corruption of Joe Biden and where’s Hunter Biden? You know where he is? He’s painting right now for 500,00 a piece. Where’s Hunter? His highest and best use, I can tell you, is in a studio to paint. Even though he’s never painted before. He set a record for the highest price for a person that never painted a picture before. Never did a painting before.
Donald Trump: (22:21)
Then without any basis whatsoever, Twitter and Facebook banned the New York Post’s account of this terrible story. After the election, one poll showed that at least 10% of Joe Biden’s voters would have switched their vote if they had known about Joe and Hunter Biden’s scandals, enough to flip the results of numerous states. But don’t worry about it, because we won those states anyway. We won them all. Probably the only thing I disagree with. It wouldn’t have mattered. They would have found the votes. They would have found those votes. If it was reported, they would have found the votes. Little more, they would have churned out some more ballots.
Donald Trump: (23:04)
The truth was covered up, and it had a giant impact on the election. This must never happen to another party’s presidential candidate again. Can never happen. We are a laughing stock all over the world. A laughing stock. And you know who knows it better than even the people in this room? Democrats. They know it. Furthermore, these big tech companies interfered with and undermined the sacred integrity of the ballot box by censoring any honest discussion of election fraud. You say election fraud, you get canceled. That’s the one thing they want to stay away from. The cancel culture, they’re very tough on it. But the thing they really don’t want is because we’re too close to home. We got too close. Read Time magazine from four months ago, the cover story. They couldn’t help themselves. It doesn’t go all the way, but it goes far enough, and you see what-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
It doesn’t go all the way, but it goes far enough and you see what they did. They want to stay away from talking about the election results. Every time the media references the election hoax, they say the fraud is “unproven. And while there is no evidence … ” No evidence? There’s so much evidence. You saw what happened in Georgia the other day. They found 35,000 votes. Then they deleted in Georgia over 100,000 votes. Because they were so bad voters, I said, “Why didn’t you try doing it before the election? Lost by this much. Why didn’t you do it before the election?” There’s bad things going on in this country, very bad things. We always had the reputation of being a wonderful, brilliant country for voting, and now everyone knows. They’ve watched, they’re very smart, and they see what happened.
Donald Trump: (25:01)
The governor of Georgia and Georgia secretary of state let us down. They let us down. And by the way, the voting law they passed is far weaker than that of Texas and other states. You hear that, Mr. Attorney General? They don’t even have signature verification. Could you imagine passing a voting law? But they’re getting a little good … because everyone thinks, “Oh, they’re passing this … ” no, it’s not. And you notice they’re the only state that’s being sued by the federal government. You know why? Because it’s an easy target, because the governor and the secretary of state won’t defend like that guy will defend.
Donald Trump: (25:44)
So I only speak the truth. So true. And the reason the Attorney General of the United States is going after Georgia is it’s so bad what they’ve done, and they’ll probably win, and that defense won’t take place. They go out and they really worked very hard on finding the right state to look at. Now Stacey Abrams in Georgia got them to sign what’s called a mandated consent decree, which was not approved by the legislature, therefore it’s illegal, and makes it very easy for Democrats to cheat and to win elections. You don’t have too many of them in Texas, do you, Louie? Doc Ronny, do we have … the great Doc Ronny, my doctor, became a Congressman. He only beat 22 people. 22 people, he was great.
Donald Trump: (26:44)
I said, “Doc, how about if I take a cognitive test?” He said, “Well, you can do it, sir. But if you do, it’ll be public.” Well, I said, “What’s wrong with that?” He said, “Well, if you don’t do well, sir, it’s not going to be pretty.” I said, “Is it hard?” He said, “After the first five questions, it gets very hard.” I said, “Let’s take a shot at it,” and we did it and we aced it, right? I aced it.
Donald Trump: (27:08)
And one of the doctors said he’s never seen anybody that aced it. And some of those questions are not easy. I will tell you that. How do you think Joe would do on a cognitive test? You never know. Maybe he’s … underneath there, there’s somebody that’s very unusual. Unfortunately, this was an election where the person that counts the votes was far more important than the candidate, no matter how many votes that candidate got, and we got record numbers of votes. It’s a disgrace to our nation and we are truly being scorned and disrespected all over the world. Never forget that the radical left is not the majority in this country. We are the majority and it’s not even close. It’s not even close. [crosstalk 00:28:24]
Donald Trump: (28:26)
And when you look at their policies, there’s just no way that can happen. There’s no way. Weak military. They fight against the military, always fighting budgets, military. We need strong military right now, so strong. And having rebuilt the US military is one of my greatest achievements. It was a sick and tired military. The equipment was old and depleted. And now we have those brand new F-35s and everything’s brand new, and we have a great military, or it’s coming soon and they won’t be able to stop it.
Donald Trump: (28:59)
But the radical left cheat in elections and the fake news media cheats in polling, like having me down 17 points just before the election in Wisconsin. “Donald Trump … ” ABC News, Washington Post, just before … now when people hear that, it’s called suppression, they say, “We love the president, but we’re going to stay home. Let’s watch television, Harry.” I said, “That’s a good idea. Harry’s going to stay home with Janet.” I’m down 17 points, and I felt I was winning the state, and we did, in my opinion, win the safe, but it was very close. Even by their fake numbers, it was very close. I’d have it down 17 points.
Donald Trump: (29:43)
And interestingly in 2016, the exact same thing happened. They had me down 19 points. Same people, ABC News, Washington Post, suppression. I was down 19 points and I won the state. So that’s a fake poll. It should be illegal. It’s a fake poll. The same people … at least they got better. They had 17 instead of 19. But I was down four years ago. We got her by surprise in 2016. They said, “We’re never going to let that happen again.” That’s what happened.
Donald Trump: (30:19)
Americans do not support the woke left. The people are with us. You have no idea how much. In a recent, highly respected Rasmussen poll, 58% of voters say the media is truly the enemy of the people. Think of that, 58%, and only 23% disagreed. Nobody can tell me that defunding the police, open borders, raising your taxes … it used to be, you’re running for office, “We’re going to cut your taxes.” This is the only time in history, “We’re going to raise your taxes.” “Oh, I’m going to vote for him. I want to raise them.” And they’re raising your taxes so you can waste this money on the Green New Deal, which is nonsense.
Donald Trump: (31:14)
So they want to put back the regulations. I took off more regulations than any president in history. And that’s what gave us really … I actually think, Louie, it was more important than the taxes, than cutting taxes. But we took off the regulations. Used to take 20 years to get highways approved and roads approved, and we got it down to two, and we’re going to try and get it down to one. Well, we were going to get it down to one. Now we’re going to have to wait a little while I guess. It’ll get back up to about 18 or 20 pretty soon, and then we’ll bring it down one day. You just wait and see.
Donald Trump: (31:54)
The Democrats are terrible on policy, but they’re very vicious and they’re smart and they stick together. They don’t have Mitt Romneys and little Ben Sasses and Bill Cassidy. How about Bill Cassidy? He campaigns in the great state of Louisiana. He compaigns that he’s Trump’s friend. Every ad has Trump in it. “Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,” and then he votes to impeach me. Can you believe it? But I always sort of felt that about that guy. Lightweight. But you have another very good senator there, John Kennedy. He’s very good. Very good senator. And Bill Cassidy can’t walk down the streets of Louisiana without having nasty things said to him, and they don’t have anyone, the Democrats, like the warmonger and most quoted Republican in the history of our country by Democrats, Liz Cheney. She’s quoted all the time. Every time a Democrat gets up to make a speech … you know this, fellows, right? You have to live with her, I guess. Maybe not much longer. But every time they get up to make a speech, “And to quote Liz Cheney … ”
Donald Trump: (33:08)
Democrats are ruthless, but they are united. They don’t have these Romney types. They don’t have them. It must be wonderful to live like that, but they have bad policy and they have policy that’s going to destroy our country. Like socialists and communists movements throughout history, today’s leftists do not believe in freedom, they do not believe in fairness, and they do not believe in democracy. They believe in Marxist morality. Anything is justified as long as it hurts their political opponents and advances the radical agenda of their party. It’s a radical agenda like nobody has seen before. Before our very eyes, the radical left Democrats are turning the law itself into a weapon for partisan persecution. It’s persecution. It’s really … look at what they’re doing to incredible people like Rudy Giuliani. I mean, he’s an incredible … greatest mayor in the history of the city of New York, great crime fighter.
Donald Trump: (34:13)
And at the same time, they’re weaponizing the IRS against conservatives and Christians just like they did with the tea party, except worse. There are now two sets of laws in this country, one for the left wing mob, the rioters and the rampagers who can do whatever the hell they want to whomever they want to do it. And there is another set of rules for law-abiding, conservative Americans, happen to be Republicans, who simply want to speak their minds and exercise their rights, like to talk about a rigged election.
Donald Trump: (34:54)
But Rudy Giuliani … and I mean that. He is by far the greatest mayor of the city. And now you realize, it means more right now, Matt, that it would have meant five years ago when you say that, because you see what the hell is happening to our cities, New York in particular.
Donald Trump: (35:12)
But one of the great crime fighters of his generation has had his law license taken away by the radical left, all because he was fighting against an election result that he saw was corrupt. That means you can never, ever fight anything. That means someday it could swing the other way, right? It could swing the other way. Probably won’t for a long time, but we’re not letting it happen. Under the standard that has now been applied to Rudy, lawyers are no longer free to represent their clients and their livelihood itself depends on one thing only, whether or not they want to fight the corruption.
Donald Trump: (35:52)
Think of it. Rudy fought because he saw the election was rigged. And because he fought, they took away his law license in New York and in Washington, DC. And this is a great man. This is a man … I lived in New York. You could walk down the streets. You were proud of the city. You’re not proud of the city anymore. You’re not proud of what’s happening. While many Democrats fought viciously and got caught lying about the 2016 election … they were lying … nothing happened. Russia, “Russia, Russia, Russia.” You remember Russia? I see Devin here. Where’s Devin? Stand up, Devin.
Donald Trump: (36:45)
When I came in, he was in the basement of an office building, the basement of the White House. They said, “Sir, there’s a Congressman.” He’s going through files and files because he knew that what shifty Schiff was saying was pure bullshit. You got it. You understood it. It was made up bull. And he and another great one … I could give it to everybody here, frankly, as far as I’m concerned, because they are great.
Donald Trump: (37:14)
And you have a star on your left. Stand up. Our star. Thank you, Barbara. Thank you. Devin always knows who to sit next to, but Devin received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along with Jim Jordan of Ohio for the incredible courage they showed. Thank you very much. But he got it a long time ago with, “Russia, Russia, Russia.”
Donald Trump: (37:44)
I tell this story, during the campaign guys would come up to me … and we’re doing well. This is 2016. We’re doing well … “Sir, do you know anything about Russia?” “No. What am I supposed to know? Russia, I know Russia. But I don’t know … ” Two months later, a guy come up, different. “Sir, what do you have to do with Russia? Do you have anything to do with her?” “No. Why do you ask?” Then after about four or five guys coming up, I’d say, “What the hell is going on with Russia?” And it was a scam.
Donald Trump: (38:14)
And then we went through years with Mueller and there was no collusion. Oh, they wanted … remember? 18 angry Democrats, oh they went after us. They’ll send everything into New York. They’ll give it a shot now. 18, they’ve already done that. In fact, it’s photocopies they used. They used photocopies of the same stuff I beat in Washington. If anyone should be losing their jobs, their law licenses, and being investigated for crimes, it’s not Rudy Giuliani, it’s Adam Schiff.
Donald Trump: (38:51)
Adam Schiff is a very dishonest guy. He used to stand up at a microphone and he used to lie like hell. I’d say, “This guy is … ” He’d stand up, “This is a sad day for our union. President Trump works for Russia.” I’d say, “What the hell is he talking about?” And I’m the one that exposed Russia for the biggest thing they’ve ever done, the pipeline to Europe. I shut it down, and now Biden opened it up. They’re going to make a fortune.
Donald Trump: (39:22)
But guys like Andy McCabe and James Comey and James Clapper, and remember the two lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page? All of the other perpetrators who have faced no consequences whatsoever, even though they knew it was a scam that they created. They created a scam. And I must be honest with you, I’ve never said this because I didn’t want to, but I will. I’m very disappointed that Bill Barr was unable to hold anyone accountable for the countless abuses of power by the Democrats.
Donald Trump: (40:05)
We didn’t hold the corrupt officials who spied on our campaign … remember I said, “They’re spying on our campaign.” And boy, that was like a lightning rod went off. Not the authors of the phony dossier, they weren’t held responsible. Not the women who slandered and lied and defamed Brett Kavanaugh. They said, ” Brett Kavanaugh, he had an affair.” They didn’t go after them. They lied so badly. Not any of the numerous criminal referrals for lying to Congress over and over again. Not any of the illegal leakers, not any of the people that were responsible for corrupting our elections. There’s no greater crime. He wanted nothing to do with it. He just didn’t want to do it. But perhaps it’s understandable because he did become a different man. I always liked him. But I said, “Bill, you got to move your ass. Our country is under attack.” But he became a different man when the Democrats viciously stated that they wanted to impeach him. They went wild. “We want to impeach him. We’re going to impeach Bill Barr. We’re going to impeach him.” He became different. I understand that. I didn’t become different. I got impeached twice. I didn’t change. I became worse.
Donald Trump: (41:46)
So I guess I can understand it. But I just a day ago received a statement from the US attorney, highly respected, in Pennsylvania, that Bill Barr would not allow him to investigate voter fraud. Can you believe it? Now, you have to understand, Philadelphia is the second most corrupt place … so I understand, okay? So I understand … in the nation. You know what first is? Detroit. Detroit was so corrupt. Philadelphia was so corrupt. But the US attorney was not allowed to investigate what … this just came out in a letter. You don’t even know about this, Devin, right? Matt, that’s a big one. What do you think? We have a letter. You’ll have to get it from him because I want to stay out of it. Get it from the US attorney, but I’m sure he’ll be willing to provide it, but he’s given it to us. He was not allowed to do his job. And I saw that. He was all enthused, and then all of a sudden it was like he was turned off. And so were others.
Donald Trump: (42:54)
This was true with so many others that when the justice department, they failed to call out the late night ballot stuffing that took place in Georgia. Remember that? Where they made up a story of a water main break in order to get people and security to leave the premises, and then they went into a rampage of stuffing, essentially, the ballots. But now that event, because of me and some very good people, is in court. Let’s see how that one turns out. And Bill Barr told me, “Sir, we’ve looked at it. We found nothing.” All you have to do is look at that tape. By the way, there was no water main. Remember? There was no water main. Remember that? I said to them, “But what about the water main?” “Oh, I didn’t hear about that.” Well, I heard about it. There was no water main break. They said there was, and the people ran, except a group of people came back. Boom, boom, boom.
Donald Trump: (44:01)
That one is easy. All you have to do is look at the tape. It’s incredible what tapes can show. The fact is, Republicans play a much nicer, kinder game than the Democrats, but based on what we’ve seen and what we’re witnessing now with all of the prosecutorial and other misconduct going on, perhaps Republicans will have to rethink their game plan. Louie Gohmert would agree with that. Louie Gohmert, I have to be careful with him. Don’t say I said it, but actually Louie Gohmert’s worse than any Democrat, but we have to hold him back. We hold him back, Doc Ronny, right? What do you think of that, Louie? You just heard something for the first time. Pretty amazing, isn’t it?
Donald Trump: (44:46)
And by the way, where’s Durham? He disappeared. Why didn’t they use the very well-done Horowitz Report? And it was very well done. It’s incredible.
Donald Trump: (44:50)
This is the Fox report. I’m John Scott. Former president Trump speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas. Let’s listen in live.
Donald Trump: (44:59)
Even the New York Times wrote the most vicious editorial about James Comey based on the Horowitz report, which talked about the crimes and bad acts committed by Comey, McCabe and others. This is even before you go with Durham. I’d like to thank Inspector General Horowitz for that report. It should have been used. They didn’t want to use it. I guess it’s deep state. I don’t know what the hell they’re thinking. Deep state? Is there something … ? But if you can’t wait for Durham, just read a man named Daryl Cooper’s brilliant thread on Twitter. He tells the whole story. You got to read it. As he put it, “We know as fact the Steele dossier was the sole evidence just to justify spying on the Trump campaign.” Think of it. They spied on my campaign and nothing will happen to them. Think of it. Can you imagine if I spied on Biden’s campaign or Obama’s campaign? Could you imagine what would have happened? They spied on my campaign, we caught them, and nothing happened. The FBI knew the Steele dossier was a DNC operation, paid for by DNC and crooked Hillary Clinton, who by the way, is the most angry person in the United States today. She’s gone away. You know why? She said, “Why the hell didn’t you do that for me in 2016?” I got it. [crosstalk 00:46:36] Again, there are more people than her.
Donald Trump: (46:39)
No, she said, “Why didn’t you do it for me?” Actually, the race was much closer. The New York Times asked me a question, what happened in 2020 that was different from 2016? I said, “Well, I’ll tell you. We did much better in 2020. We got 12 million more votes. We won by a much bigger margin.” 2016 was very close, but Hillary said, “Why didn’t you do that for me? Why didn’t you cheat for me, damn it?” I could have been somebody. Could have been somebody.
Donald Trump: (47:16)
Steele’s source told the FBI the info, was totally unserious, and they did not inform the court of any of this, and they kept on spying on the Trump campaign. In addition, the press is part of this crooked operation. You know that. Election rules were changed. Big tech censored the opposition. Political violence was legitimized and encouraged by the left. And then Trump, the President of the United States, was banned from the social media, as we call it, by sleazebags I was banned by sleazebags. I was banned by bad people. They’re far worse … I don’t say I’m perfect, but they’re far worse than I am. They are far …
Donald Trump: (48:03)
I wouldn’t say I’m perfect, but they’re far worse than I am. I [inaudible 00:48:03]. They are far worse. In other words, the entire system was rigged against the American people and rigged against a fair, decent, and honest election. For decades, the conservative movement acted as if all that mattered were policy fights in Washington or that all it would take to prevail was winning a small handful of Supreme Court cases. And we’re disappointed in the Supreme Court. I’m disappointed, but the battle is so much bigger and so much broader than any of that. The radical left has been methodically taking over every giant centralized institution in American life. The school systems, you see that, the universities, the bar associations, look at what happened to Rudy… Hollywood journalists, the big banks, big tech, and even the Supreme Court where we’re getting some unexpected rulings because the nine justices do not want to be packed. And the Democrats are in a position to pack the court and they don’t want to be packed. So they don’t want to look at the election. They said, we don’t want to see it.
Donald Trump: (49:18)
We had by that gentleman right there from the great state of Texas, we had almost 20 states. And we thought we had a case where the standing was so good. You know, I wanted to do it personally, but they said, “Sir, you’re the president. You have no standing.” I said, “What kind of a system? Wait a minute. I’m the president.” They said, “The thing that has the standing are states. And if you could get one or two or three…” They got almost 20 and they were really strong about it. And you know, the justices never looked at the case. They didn’t look. And many of the judges didn’t look at the case, but we do have cases going on right now where I think you have patriot judges. And we’ll see. We’re going to see if that happens. But if the justices got their way, they won’t be packed. In other words, what happened is vicious things. Look at the Schumer statement that he said when he was on the court steps.
Donald Trump: (50:14)
So, he’s no longer protected because he’s not… In Congress, if you’re a guy like Adam Schiff, you can lie and lie and lie. You can’t do anything, you have immunity. But once you step out of that building, Schumer said horrible things. He said a mafia like statement to the judges. Nothing happens, nothing happens. But they are playing the ref, you know, playing the ref? Even better than the great Bobby Knight in his prime. I love Bobby Knight. He came out from great state of Indiana. He came out, he endorsed me. It was over in Indiana, but Bobby Knight used to scream at the refs. And they’d say, “Why are you doing that? You’re never going get to get the call changed.” “No, no. I’m not worried about this goal. But the next call, they’ll be thinking about…”
Donald Trump: (50:56)
That’s what’s happening with our Supreme Court. That’s what’s happened. They don’t want to be packed. We don’t want to have 24 judges. You know, they said 13. I said, the Democrats are too smart for 13. It’s an unlucky number. Why would they have 13? So they’ll make it 15, but they’ll probably make it 23, 21, 19. It’ll go up. And you know, if they would’ve looked at the case, we would have won that case in my opinion. And they would have never been packed because you would’ve had a beautiful veto sitting right in the oval office. I would have vetoed it because it’s a terrible thing. But the Democrats are vicious to the Supreme Court and to Kavanaugh. He’s another one. “Yeah, Bill Barr”, they screamed, “we’re going to impeach him. We’re going to impeach him.” And it changes people.
Donald Trump: (51:47)
And how about Brett Kavanaugh? We’re going to impeach him on women that admitted ultimately that nothing happened. They weren’t even in the country, one of them. It was all a made up scam. They should be prosecuted. They should be prosecuted. And they weren’t. But with Brett Kavanaugh, they’re screaming, “We’re going to impeach him every time [inaudible 00:52:14].” “And we’re going to impeach him.” And you know what? How does he get out of that by voting for the Democrats? So it’s a very sad thing. And he went through what no other person I have ever seen go through. That hearing was the most vicious, horrible hearing I think in the history of our country. I don’t think there’s ever been anything worse than that. In New York City and state, far left Democrats actually ran for office promising to prosecute me, my family, and my company, without knowing anything about me. I never even heard of these people. They didn’t know nothing about me. We’re going to get him.
Donald Trump: (52:52)
“We’re going to get him. We’re going to get Trump.” And she won. She won. A lot of people running, she won on the basis, ” We’re going to get him.” “What did he do?” “I don’t know, but we’ll find something.” No, no, how would you like this? They’re in search of a crime. To them, it did not matter whether any laws had been broken. The crime was opposing the radical left Democrat party. This is lawless and tyrannical behavior. It’s a political persecution, like something straight out of the communist countries that you see around the world. The few that are left. Yet, it’s happening here in America at the hands of radical left Democrats. And the Republicans again, they just don’t seem to understand at that top level, what the hell is happening. They don’t do it the same way. And maybe they’re going to have to change our job.
Donald Trump: (53:55)
And our mission is to resist this poison and fight for our Republic, with all of our heart and with all of ourselves. For decades, the career politicians who sold out our country shipped away our millions and millions of jobs and sent our children to die in endless foreign wars have gotten away with the most flagrant corruption imaginable. These people sold out our country. As vice-president Joe Biden flew his son Hunter around the world on Air Force Two, sucking up money like a vacuum cleaner, Hunter’s emails show that he collected millions and millions of dollars from foreign nations, including Ukraine. While setting aside a cut to the big guy. Who is the big guy? That’s Joe Biden. Well is that allowed to…? And Joe Biden said, they’re not getting the billion dollars unless that prosecutor is out. What the hell? Could you imagine if I said that? If I said that they impeached me and nothing happened. Can you imagine if I said, “They’re not getting their billionaire and voila, he was gone. He was bragging. I don’t know what the hell he was thinking when he… Did he know the tape was running when he did that? And nothing happens, nothing happens. You know why? Because Bill Barr is a nice man. Bill Barr and the Republicans are too nice. They’re too nice. These are vicious, vicious people. And they will destroy our country and they will do whatever they can to do it. Hunter said that he gave half of his salary to pop and that he paid vast amounts of money for Joe Biden’s expenses. Now, Joe Biden has all these houses. He’s always been like a Senator or a Congressman, right? For many years. Louie, I didn’t know you made that kind of money that you had mansions. You have mansions? Does Louie Gohmert have mansions all over Texas? I don’t think so. He’s got one house and that’s enough. That’s all you need, right Louie? Wants to go home to his bathroom and his bedroom and use his one toothbrush right? No, but Joe’s got a lot of toothbrushes. Yet not a single member of our treacherous, corrupt political establishment has ever experienced anything like the deranged and demented persecution that has been directed at me, my family, and everyone associated with us, everybody. I came down the escalator with our great future first lady. She was great. She had a very successful career. Did really well until she met me and so much for that career. That’s all right. She’s cool. She’s the coolest and most confident person. She gets it better than anybody. And she loves you people. She loves you, but that’s when all of these witch hunts began. All because I put America first, all because of MAGA: Make America Great Again. And now, it’s also because I got more votes, 75 million, than anybody in the history of the presidency. And far more than Clinton, far more than Obama, and a record 12 million more than 2016. Think of it, in the history, usually they go down a little bit second term and they win, but they go down a little bit. I was told by a great pollster, really somebody great, John McLaughlin, one of the most respected one. Sir, you got 63 million votes. If you get it up to 64 or 65, nobody can beat you. Can’t lose. Thank you John, very much. I got it to 75 and I lost in quotes. I lost. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And what they’ve done to this movement, I think they’ve made the movement stronger. I’ll tell you, in a certain way, I think that is.
Donald Trump: (58:31)
I’ll never forget it. On election night, we did so much better than they ever thought in their wildest imagination. That they just said, “The hell with it. Let it go.” What they did, what they did. I’m also leading in the polls against Harris. Because not a lot of people think that Joe’s going to be running, but you never know. It is a strange world and everyone else who’s going to run on the radical left, whether it’s on the Democrat side or the… I love my Republicans, but we’re really kicking their ass too. But we love them. But we like it because they’re friends of ours, right? So it’s okay. I think we can say that affectionately. No, they’re great. They’re great. And they’re working hard and you saw a lot of them this weekend. But the Democrats want me out and they want me out as fast as possible. And here I am, I could have a nice, beautiful life. And here I am on a Sunday in Texas.
Donald Trump: (01:00:23)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. No, I said to Matt and Mercedes because I’ve done this and we’ve had… And by the way, you have a poll coming out. Unfortunately, I want to know what it is they… You know, they do that straw poll, right? Now, if it’s bad, I just say, “It’s fake.” If it’s good, I say, “That’s the most accurate poll perhaps ever.” And I know that they it. I guess it gets announced after… I want to find out, are you going to…?
Donald Trump: (01:00:55)
Oh, he won’t. He won’t tell me. I know Matt, he won’t tell me. Well, whenever the hell they get it released. I’ll tell you, here’s the story. If it’s bad, it’ll be front page news in the newspapers. If it’s great, they won’t even cover it. I hate to tell you that, Matt. And I don’t want to convince him to do a bad Paul, but you know the straw poll. So, I did this years ago and I got these great straw polls. It was the first time I ever did it. And I was a novice, but it was right here at CPAC. And I’m so proud of the jump. I mean, look at this room. Look at outside. We have thousands of people trying to come in. I mean our only thing is next time we’ll have to get a bigger place, I guess, right? Next time.
Donald Trump: (01:01:33)
But I said to Matt, and much more importantly, I said to Mercedes, I said, “Give me Death Valley. Give me the worst time. The worst slot, we’ll fill it up.” He said, “Well, sir, that would be Sunday afternoon because most people are doing other things.” I said, “That’s okay, Matt. You don’t have to give me Friday night or Saturday night, which is easy.” That’s too easy. We love doing it the hard way. I said, “Give me any time you want on Sunday that’s good. I’ll fly in.” And look at this crowd we got. And look at the love in this room. Look at the love.
Donald Trump: (01:02:16)
Nah, we’ll give Saturday night to Louie and to the doc. We’ll give Saturday night… We’ll give Saturday night, Byron. We’re going to give Saturday night to Devin. We’re going to give somebody Friday night, which is almost as good. They give me Sunday and I love Sunday. You know why? It reminds me of church and that’s okay. But no I’m honored that… It really is. I said, “Give me your worst time. I don’t care.” And he gives me the worst time. He actually did. And he just broke his record.
Donald Trump: (01:02:49)
The radical left and the failed political establishment hates our movement for a simple reason because together we took on the corrupt special interests. We faced down the open borders that you’re saying so much, how bad are these borders. They’re coming out of the prisons, they’re coming out of everywhere in these other countries. They think we’re so stupid. They’re letting their prisoners out, floating in through the caravans, come into our country: murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers of women. It’s mostly women. We stood up to the absurd dictates of political correctness. And we called out the people who were getting rich bleeding our country dry. And many of them were politicians. Against the howls and cries of the corporate interests and the Washington lobbyists, we demanded fair trade for the American workers and we did a great job on that. We finally ended the worst trade deal in the history of our country, NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals. I don’t want to disrespect our past, but the people that negotiated that deal were either stupid or corrupt. They say both. Could be. We withdrew from the horrible Transpacific Partnership, would have destroyed your automobile business.
Donald Trump: (01:04:14)
We pulled out of the world health organization scam. You know, the world health organization. I pulled out because they’re like a pipe organ for China, right? So I pulled out. they called me, would they want us back? So, the guy, just nice guy, he wants us back. “Sir, we really want you back. We really want you back.” I said, “How much are we paying?” “Almost 500 million a year.” “How much is China paying?” “39 million a year.” I said, “Okay. So let me ask you a question. We have 325 million people not including illegal aliens.” Which who the hell knows. I don’t think they have any idea what… “But we have 325 million people. China has 1.4 billion people. They’re paying 39. We’re paying 500. So let me ask you a question. Would you take us back if we paid 39?” “Yes.” I said, “Okay, I’m going to think about it.” But when I pulled out, it was so popular. I couldn’t even get back in for 39 because everybody including Doc Ronnie thought it was amazing that I pulled out because he understands it’s a pipe organ for China and for others, but mostly for China. So I said, “So, I would get back in for 39 million?” “Yes, sir.” Okay. That was it. I didn’t go back in even at 39 and otherwise I turned it down.
Donald Trump: (01:05:35)
And now because of the rigged election, we’re out, he’s in. And he immediately says, “We’re going back in.” He went back in for the same price that they were paying before. Now, you know what? 450 million in terms of when you’re dealing with billions and trillions and all of this, it’s not… It’s a lot of money. This is a year. This is every year we pay almost 500 million. They pay 39 million. Their country is much larger, but why wouldn’t they say we’ll do it for 39 or in theory less? Let us in for 10. I think they would have taken it. In fact, one of the reasons I wasn’t happy, I should have started off lower, Matt. Instead of 30, I said, “How about would you do it for nine?” Proportional, right? So, they go back in and nobody said, “We’ll go back in, but we want to come back in at 39 million or 30 million or 20 million.”
Donald Trump: (01:06:31)
They said, “We’ll go back in. We’ll go back in.” And now they’re going to be paying what we’ve been ripped off for years. And we don’t have control of it. China has total absolute control. We have none. What do you think of that, Matt? In the second row, our acting Attorney General, huh? Our acting… You took a lot of abuse. Thank you, Matt. Thank you for being here, up here. I just see you there. Thank you. So think of it. So, we have this deal and they just go in… This is the way our country runs. It’s the way our country runs. We built an aircraft carrier and the aircraft carrier has all sorts of problems. It’s the Gerald Ford. They decided to use magnets for the elevators that bring… Magnets. You’re in the middle of the ocean, big waves, bullets being shot at your ship. You got magnets. I could take this little glass of water, drop it in the magnets, that’s the end of the elevator.
Donald Trump: (01:07:29)
And then they throw the plane off and they decided to do it through electric instead of steam, right? Catapult it’s called. So, they have a catapult. And for 60 years it’s been steam operated. They decide to do it. Let’s make it out of electric. So, I go to the ship because it’s been under construction for years, it was going to cost two and a half billion. It’s going to end up costing 18 billion. But the bad news is it doesn’t work. They even moved the tower from the center to the back of the ship, making it much harder for pilots to land. By the way, the single hardest thing for a pilot to do is land on an aircraft carrier, even great pilots can’t do it.
Donald Trump: (01:08:12)
If they’re a little bit claustrophobic… That carrier looks big, but when you’re up there flying and moving along at rapid speeds, and you’re looking at this massive ocean and you have a little deck that you have to land on, it’s the hardest thing to do. So they move the thing back so it made it much tighter instead of putting it in the middle where it’s a wider part of the ship, a whole thing. Another thing, what’s under there? “That’s sir, where they keep the ammunition.” I said, “Wait a minute, they built the tower…” I don’t want to be the captain of that ship by the way. So I said, I went to visit the ship and I wasn’t interested in seeing the admiral, the admiral said, “Sir Admiral so-and-so…” The things out to sea trials is not working. And I said, “Admiral, honestly, I think you’re a wonderful man. Very good looking guy. Actually, you’re like central casting, but I want to see the catapulters. So, I meet these five guys. Real great guys. They’re catapulters. How long have you been doing it, Jim? “Sir, 21 years.” I said, “Let me ask you, you have a problem with it?” “Absolutely, sir. It doesn’t work.” “Why?” He said, “Because if it breaks, you have to go through graduate school at MIT to fix it. And with the steam, we had the same power or more and we could fix it with a blowtorch and a hammer. And I love that steam in my face, sir.” I said, “But seriously, which is better?” He said, “The steam.” I said, “Why did they go with electric?” “Because sir, it can go back and forth automatically all day long.” I said, “Is that good or bad?” He said, “Unnecessary because it takes us one minute and 59 seconds to put the plane on and hook it up. And by the time we do that, sir, we’re all set. We have so much steam we don’t know what to do with it.” So, I said, “So you mean they spent all of this money.” They spent $900 million as of a year ago to try and fix it. Okay. 900 million.
Donald Trump: (01:10:11)
It’ll never work. I told them that three… When I first came in, I’m very good at this stuff. I said, “Electric. Give me a glass of water. I will put it out of commission. I’ll throw it on the electric circuits. It’s not going to work.” And it’s just, I mean, it’s so we do things so stupidly. So they’re at $18 billion. And I said, did you sue the shipyard? “No, sir.” Then I meet with the architect. I said, “You’re the architect?” “Yes.” “Have you ever designed a ship before?” My first question, “Have you ever designed a ship before?” I’m telling you foreign countries are laughing at us. They’re laughing at us. How stupid we are.
Donald Trump: (01:10:52)
We renegotiated the Korea trade deal and we built the greatest economy of the history of the world with a record 160 million people working. We were never close. And I do not want to see any negotiations of tax increases by Senate Republicans. Because I see certain rhinos they keep walking over to the White House. They’re getting fleeced. I feel so badly. You know, guys like Romney and they walk over to the White House. The other half, the Senator from Louisiana, he was over there. I don’t want to name them all because a couple of them are fine, but they go over there, they’re getting fleeced. They come out, we have a deal. We have a deal. Remember England? We have a deal. You don’t want to get into that. We have a deal. They said they had a deal. 20 minutes later when the radical left heard that Biden agreed to something they went crazy and then Biden said, “We don’t have a deal anymore.” They’re getting fleeced. And what they’re doing is they’re saying, “We’ll agree to raise your taxes. If you approve this…”
Donald Trump: (01:12:03)
Saying we’ll agree to raise your taxes if you approve this radical left infrastructure deal, where most of the money, almost none of the money’s going to real infrastructure, which is roads, bridges, et cetera. I’m telling the Republican senators right now that we’re not going to stand for it if you raise our taxes. We had the greatest tax decrease in the history of our country, and we’re not going to have you raise it. In order to say you’ve made a bipartisan deal. You know, they’re dying to say, Matt, that we made a bipartisan deal. You don’t have to do that, because you’re getting fleeced. It’s all green new deal stuff. It’s nonsense. And it’s going to destroy our country.
Donald Trump: (01:12:40)
And inflation’s going to be a big problem. We can’t let it happen. Despite the pleading and begging of the outsourcers and globalists, I took on China like no president had ever done before. Imposing massive tariffs to protect American workers and bring jobs and factories and billions and billions of dollars back. You know that? Back to our shores. We made a great deal with China, which has immeasurably helped our farmers and manufacturers, and we put the Chinese Communist Party on defense for the first time ever in our history of our country. We never took in 25 cents. They’re paying us millions.
Donald Trump: (01:13:24)
It’s interesting. Biden, he wants to end the tariffs. If he does, China will take over the whole deal. Okay? But they’re finding it hard to do. He campaigned on ending tariffs, which was stupid. Although maybe not so stupid, right? You know what happened. You know what happened. But he campaigned on ending tariffs. So ridiculous. We’re taking billions and billions, and we convinced the world that we have to watch China. When I took over, we had a deficit with China of 507 billion dollars. That’s not sustainable. 507. Not million. 507 million’s a lot. 507 billion dollars. But now China is totally on the offense, making Joe Biden and our country look week, and pathetic.
Donald Trump: (01:14:19)
We ignored the hysterics of the socialist left and withdrew from the unfair one sided Paris climate accord. One of the great rip offs. Would have cost us a trillion dollars. We unleashed America’s energy resources, and achieved American energy independence for the first time in the history of our country. And we don’t need windmills in Texas and lots of other places. We don’t need windmills. They ought to end that program as quickly as they can.
Donald Trump: (01:14:58)
When the plague came in from China, I dragged the slow and complacent bureaucrats from the FDA, and the CDC into the Oval Office. I pushed them like they have never been pushed before, and thanks to the relentless efforts of my administration and me, we got miraculous therapeutics straight to patients with historic speed, and we produced three vaccines to end the pandemic in record time. Would have never happened. Would have never happened. We did it in less than nine months. They said a minimum of three years, probably five years, and sir, it probably won’t happen at all. If we didn’t have that, we would be in a position like perhaps over a 100 years ago, right? 1917. Over 100 people, I hear different number. But perhaps as many as 100 million people died.
Donald Trump: (01:15:57)
We beat back the failed foreign policy establishment to withdraw from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We ended the endless wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, and other countries. And we brought our beautiful troops back home. Now terrible things are happening in Afghanistan. We had everything in place to finish withdrawing responsibly, and Joe Biden is turning it into a total disaster. They don’t respect him. He’s leaving behind billions and billions of dollars of equipment. I told these generals, “I want every nail brought back home. I want the tanks brought back home. I want it all brought back home.” Instead, the Taliban is now parading around with our weapons that Joe Biden allowed them to capture. It’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (01:17:13)
But with all of that being said, we should get out. 21 years is enough. 21 years. 21 years is enough. Everything we do, we refuse to bow down to the radical left, the RINOs, the political establishment, and instead we insist on standing up for America, and making America great again and always putting America first. America’s got to be first.
Donald Trump: (01:17:44)
Every day, more people are realizing that we were right on all of the key issues, and that this is one reason why our endorsement has become, and it’s really not just my endorsement, it’s your endorsement, has become the most powerful weapon in politics. Last year, exact numbers. Because if they weren’t exact, they will come out at me, you wouldn’t believe. 120 of the 122 candidates we endorsed in Congressional primary elections won. So think of that. And the two that didn’t, actually they turned out to be great Trump people. They really did. They turned out to be great.
Donald Trump: (01:18:26)
But we had a great string of endorsements. We love the candidates we endorse. We’re endorsing a lot of good ones right now in the Senate primary elections. We were undefeated, 21 and 0. 21 and 0. Can’t say I’m happy about all of them, but that’s okay. So far in the 2022 election cycle, we are already 10 and 0 on endorsements, and you’re going to check this. Oh, they’ll be checking today. Matt, they’re going to be up there tonight checking. Oh, they want to find it’s not. It’s not 10 and 0, it’s 10 and 1. He lied, he lied. He’s a terrible person.
Donald Trump: (01:19:02)
In the face of the Biden administration’s far left campaign to transform our country and erase our history, we are not backing down. We will never back down. When we regain control of Congress, we will immediately regain control of our border, and it’s not that easy. I watched a lot of good Congressmen get onto it. What we have to do is redo the Trump edict. It’s not that easy. We negotiated with those countries, and it wasn’t simple. Very complex. We had it better than ever before. It’s so sad to see what happened.
Donald Trump: (01:19:41)
We will hold China accountable for the damage and suffering they have caused, and make them pay trillions of dollars in reparations to us and to the world. We will break up the big tech monopolies, and bring back free speech. We can’t let this continue. We will take back our elections, and finally, we will always include a thing called voter ID. That’s another thing. The Democrats are now saying, “Oh, we always wanted voter ID.” There was a poll. 88% of the people in the country want voter ID, so now the Democrats again, same old story. They’re saying, ” We want voter ID. We’ve always wanted voter ID.”
Donald Trump: (01:20:34)
These people are sick. We will completely defund and bar critical race theory. 1776, not 1619, if you don’t mind. And if government run schools are going to teach children to hate their country, we will demand school choice that we already have. If you listen to the media or watch the evening newscast, our country has really gone bad. All we talk about is race. That’s all they talk about. Race. The whole show. race, race. We don’t talk about our country being great anymore. We don’t talk about how America can lead the world. We don’t talk about stopping crime or the hundreds and hundreds of people that are being shot in Democrat run cities and what to do about it.
Donald Trump: (01:21:31)
We don’t talk about ending the drugs pouring across our borders. Which I had greatly reduced with our wall and so many other things that we’re doing. And most importantly, we never talk about the great future of our country. We don’t talk about any of this stuff anymore. The Democrat controlled media talks race, race, race for political reasons. And they always have, but never like this. But it’s hurting our country, and more than anyone else, our great minority communities. It’s hurting them very badly.
Donald Trump: (01:22:05)
The Democrat obsession with race is only dragging us backward into the past, and it is bringing our country down to a point where even China and Russia are lecturing us on human rights, race, and they’re doing it in a very humiliating fashion. This never happened. Never happened with me. During my administration, our country was respected again. It is no longer respected.
Donald Trump: (01:22:37)
In conclusion, our party and our movement, we’re all united by the same shared American values, and by unyielding resolve to defend our beloved nation for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We take great pride in our country, and we teach the truth about our history. We celebrate our rich heritage and national traditions. We honor George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and all of our national heroes.
Donald Trump: (01:23:13)
And of course, we always respect our great American flag. We believe in patriotic education for our children, and we strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America’s youth. We are committed to defending innocent life, and to proudly upholding the Judaeo Christian values of our nation’s founders. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctness, and we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture.
Donald Trump: (01:24:03)
We believe in our Constitution and in law and order. We want law and order. We demand law and order. We don’t want people shot and killed in our cities. We totally respect and support the men and women of law enforcement. They will never be defunded. We are devoted to our communities. We are loyal to our fellow citizens, and above all, we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust.
Donald Trump: (01:24:48)
These are the convictions that define our movement today, and must define the Republican Party, which has truly become the party of the working man and woman. The working man, the working woman. That’s what’s happening. Look how many people are joining. We have a much different party than we had five years ago. You were in big trouble, Republicans, and look what’s happening. Now for the next 16 months, we must pour every ounce of our energy into winning a historic victory in the midterms. We will never give up our search for truth and justice for what happened in the corrupt presidential election of 2020 because without that truth, we cannot have an honest election in 2022 or 2024, no matter what they want to tell you.
Donald Trump: (01:25:46)
And our country will soon stand proudly for free and strong and proper elections again. The election fraud of 2020 is the single most requested topic for me and others to talk about. Ahead of the border, even ahead of crime. Because think of what they’ve done. What they’ve done is so sad. Look what’s happened to our country in just a short number of months. Everyone here today and every conservative all across our land needs to decide right now that together we will save this country. We must decide that we will not stop. We will not rest until our American heritage of freedom, liberty, and justice is once again safe and once again secure.
Donald Trump: (01:26:48)
We owe our country nothing less than that. Our glorious American inheritance was passed down to us by generations of American patriots who gave everything they had. Their sweat, their blood, and even their way of lives to build America into the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are not going to let it be taken away from us by a small group of radical left Marxist maniacs. We’re not going to let it happen.
Donald Trump: (01:27:24)
We will protect and defend our cherished American legacy and freedom for ourselves, for our children, and for every future generation. My fellow Americans, our movement is the greatest in American history, and it has just begun.
Donald Trump: (01:27:44)
With your help, your devotion, your brilliance, and your drive, we will carry forward the torch of American liberty. We will lead the conservative movement and the Republican Party back to victory, and it will be a greater victory than this party has ever had. We will take back the House. We will take back the Senate, and then after witnessing all that has gone wrong in our country in such a short period of time, with our borders, with our economy, with crime, we will take back that glorious White House. That sits so majestically in our nation’s capital. Beautiful white house. That’s small letters. White house. That beautiful white house. And it is the most beautiful house of all.
Donald Trump: (01:28:52)
Working together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you.

			Brooke Rollins: (00:00)
… In the way. There’s no topic on which they, the elites, the big firms, the progressives, the office holders and the bureaucrats, there is no other topic that they are seeing as a bigger obstacle to achieve their ambitions than the first amendment. The first amendment, the bulwark of our liberties, is what enables us as citizens to resist them at every turn. The first amendment truly stands between them and us. When they try to tell us what to read, the first amendment gets in their way. When they try to tell us what to think, the first amendment gets in their way.
Brooke Rollins: (00:42)
When they try to tell us what to believe, the first amendment gets in their way. And when they try to tell us with whom to worship, with whom to associate, with whom to congregate and with whom to be friends, the first amendment gets in their way. It’s no surprise then that they want the first amendment gone. They don’t advocate for abolition of course, they know better than that. But they do advocate for curtailing it into meaninglessness. Nowhere is that more evident than in the suppression of first amendment rights online. In just a minute, the President will talk about this and what he intends to do about it.
Brooke Rollins: (01:28)
It’s enough for me to say this. What was just a decade back a mere fiction of paranoid dystopia, a handful of technology companies effectively seizing control of the American public square, is now our own present reality. Against them, this president fights for you as he always has and as he always will. Ultimately, the issue at hand is the same issue that has gripped the nation since the day, almost exactly six years ago, when Donald Trump made his famous escalator ride into history, becoming Candidate Trump, and then Nominee Trump, and then President Trump.
Brooke Rollins: (02:12)
The issue is simply this. It was then, it is today. Who rules in America? Is it a handful of unaccountable and unelected elites who concoct and enforce standards arbitrarily? If so, we should pack up the American experiment, call the American dream done, issue aristocratic titles and be done with the charade. Or are the rulers of this country still the people, the democratic citizenry who do honest work every single day and ask only for a fair and equitable treatment in return? We need that answer. This country just finished an Independence Day celebration, where we talked about and celebrated everything we have been and everything we have meant as a country. For the sake of future independence days, for the sake of future American generations, we must fight for the people’s rule. That’s what Donald Trump is here to do and that’s what he’s always done. Please help me welcome President Donald J. Trump.
Donald Trump: (03:25)
Thank you very much, Brooke, I appreciate that. Thank you everybody. I just want to say that I stand before you this morning to announce a very important and very beautiful, I think, development for our freedom and our freedom of speech, and that goes to all Americans. Today in conjunction with the America first policy Institute, I’m filing as the lead class representative, a major class action lawsuit against the big tech giants, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey, three real nice guys. We’re asking the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies’ illegal, shameful censorship of the American people, and that’s exactly what they are doing. We’re demanding an end to the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well. Our case will prove this censorship is unlawful, it’s unconstitutional and it’s completely un-American.
Donald Trump: (04:57)
We all know that very, very well. Our filing also seeks injunctive relief to allow prompt restitution and really restoration and you can name about 20 other things and it has to be prompt because it’s destroying our country. Of my accounts, in addition, we are asking the court to impose punitive damages on these social media giants. We’re going to hold big tech very accountable. This is the first of numerous other lawsuits, I assume that would follow. But this is the lead and I think it’s going to be a very, very important game changer for our country. It will be a pivotal battle in the defense of the first amendment. And in the end, I am confident that we will achieve a historic victory for American freedom and at the same time freedom of speech. So I want to thank all of the exceptional legal team behind this effort.
Donald Trump: (06:09)
In particular [inaudible 00:06:10] we have a lot of the tobacco lawyers. I said, “Who are the best lawyers?” Well, the tobacco lawyers seem to do a very good job. So I figured let’s see if they want to do it, and they really wanted to do it. We have great, great talent. I also want to thank Brooke Rollins, just an outstanding person and friend. She’s carrying it out to a level that nobody saw and she’s done it very quickly together with Linda McMahon, a tremendously successful woman who did an incredible job in the administration, one of the best, and everyone at the America first policy Institute for their support of this vital initiative. From the very beginning of our nation, freedom of speech has always been understood as a bedrock of our liberty and our strength. In America, we recognize that the freedom to speak our minds and express the truth, that is our heart, that’s really a big chunk of our heart. It is our heart. It is not granted to us by government, it’s given to us by God and no one should have the power to take that right away. The founding fathers inscribed this right in the very first amendment to our constitution because they knew that free speech is essential to the prevention, and look, to the prevention of horror and to the preservation of our republic. But remember the words, the prevention of horror, because we’re very close to seeing that now in our country. We’ve never been in a position like this, and it’s all happened very quickly. In the words of the father of our country, although some would like to take that title away from him, George Washington, he will not be canceled. If freedom of speech may be taken away, then dumb and silent, we may be led like sheep to the slaughter, pretty well-known phrase and so true. Unfortunately today, this fundamental American right on liberty is under incredible threat and attack by a lot of different sides.
Donald Trump: (08:48)
But we are the majority side by a lot. I believe we are the majority side by far more than anybody would understand. You just have to take a look at what happened in recent elections and add up the right numbers. You will see a majority like you wouldn’t believe because nobody can believe what some of the things that are being said are. Nobody believes that. Social media has given extraordinary power to a group of big tech giants that are working with government, the mainstream media and a large segment of a political party to silence and suppress the views of the American people and they’ve been very, very successful at that. Not in all cases, but in many cases, totally successful. While the social media companies are officially private entities, in recent years they have ceased to be private with the enactment and their historical use of section 230, which profoundly protects them from liability.
Donald Trump: (09:54)
Once they got section 230, they’re not private companies anymore in a lot of views. No other companies in our country, and even in our country’s history, have had protection like this. It’s, in effect, a massive government subsidy. These companies have been co-opted, coerced and weaponized by government and by government actors to become the enforces of illegal, unconstitutional censorship. And that’s what it is at the highest level, censorship. And so many other things that perhaps are even worse. And you’ll be seeing that in this lawsuit, as it wells its way through the courts, we have all seen Democrats in Congress hall the CEOs of these companies before their committees and attempt to threaten them, bully them and intimidate them like nobody has been intimidated. But they made a deal. They all get along very nicely now, thank you very much. Congress has repeatedly told big tech that if they do not silence Democrats’ political opponents, ban prominent conservative voices, I wonder who that would be, and restrict what the left ominously labels as disinformation, and they are the greatest disinformation group of people ever, ever in the world. As an example, just recently, now they’re saying, “We never said defund the police. We want to fund the police.” They looked at poll numbers at 85% against them. “No, no, no. We want to take care of the police state.” No, they don’t. They want to fund the police. And they’ll say it thousands and thousands and thousands of times. And by the end of 12 months, you’ll all be saying, “Oh, they love the police.” They don’t love the police. They actually hate the police for whatever reason, and it’s just a terrible thing. And so many other-
Donald Trump: (12:03)
… for whatever reason, and it’s just a terrible thing. And so many other things. They’re changing their views on so many other things and they just say the opposite. They don’t even go to anything. They just all in unison, a lot of the people sitting right before me understand exactly what I’m saying. They say it right before you. That we want to do this. We want to do that. It’s the exact opposite of what they’ve been saying. Or, probably the most famous of all, Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump loves Russia. He loves Russia. He loves Putin. He loves Russia. That went on for two years and some people believed it, but we are going to look so closely and we’re going to make sure that the liability protections that they have under section 230 is at a very minimum changed. And maybe at a maximum taken away.
Donald Trump: (12:54)
The Supreme Court has made it exceedingly clear that Congress is not allowed to coerce private entities into doing what Congress does. They’re not allowed to do it. The lawful authority is just not there. They can’t do it. They bully and they coerce. Yet, that’s exactly what’s taking place every single day. It’s a flagrant violation of The Constitution going on before our very eyes. I hate to say this, but they do it with the Supreme Court, too. They play the refs. They play the refs. They talk about all sorts of things they’re going to do to Supreme Court justices. We’re going to impeach him. We’re going to impeach him. We’re going to impeach him. And then, lo and behold, all of a sudden different decisions come out. Or, we’re going to enlarge that court to a level that nobody can believe. We are going to take that court and we’re going to enlarge. We’re going to have 16. We’re going to have 20. I saw one the other day, we’re going to have 24 justices.
Donald Trump: (14:07)
I guess things happen because all of a sudden decisions come out. They play the ref. They play the ref better than Bobby Knight has ever played the ref. We can’t let that happen and hopefully our Supreme Court justices and other judges and justices, they stand up for our values and they don’t let that happen. In addition, in recent years, we have also seen increasing coordination between big tech, giants and government agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control. Where so much was wrong. So many things could have been different, but big tech happened to choose the wrong side and they banned the right side. For example, YouTube’s policy, explicitly forbids contradicting ” health authorities.”
Donald Trump: (15:03)
You know the health authorities. Fortunately, I overrode the health authorities quite a bit. That was a lot of good decisions made. If I didn’t, we would have been in much bigger trouble. Like you see other countries right now are still in very, very big trouble. Through such coordination, the federal government has essentially deputized social media platforms to become the defacto censorship arm of the US government, which is exactly what’s happened. This was especially clear during the pandemic when social media giants began censoring information, according to guidance by the CDC, which as we now know, was very often incorrect or wrong.
Donald Trump: (15:52)
This censorship is yet another blatant violation of the constitution. There are so many violations of our constitution and you’ll see that in the suit, which will also be added to, because other things are happening on a daily basis, that will be added as we go along. Consider just some of the information that has been censored in America over the past year. Until recently, Facebook had a policy to eliminate all posts sharing evidence that the horrible virus emerged from China. They said it didn’t emerge from the Chinese lab. Wuhan. Remember? I said, Wuhan and it was like a bomb went up.Wuhan. Came from the Wuhan lab. Of course there were body bags all outside the lab. Nobody ever mentions that. I wonder why?
Donald Trump: (16:45)
They said it came a thousand miles away from a bat or it came from another country. They tried to blame Italy. They tried to blame us. But they gave that one up. That was also misinformation. But then it was finally revealed that this was most likely the truth. That it came from the lab. And it was a small little story. But when I said it it was like a weapon went off. A major weapon. I won’t use the word weapon, because I never used the word nuclear, but we have to be careful with our leadership because if we don’t have the proper leadership, we’re in a very perilous state. So we don’t use the word nuclear. I never use it. Okay? Never use it. I never said it. That’s called disinformation.
Donald Trump: (17:32)
Google and YouTube have deleted countless videos that dared to question the judgment of the World Health Organization, which has been wrong so often. It’s been a really pipe organ for China, as most of you know. Calling those videos misinformation, including videos that consist of clear scientific fact. Doctors and medical groups have been barred from these platforms for posting about therapeutics, such as hydroxychloroquine. Huh. That’s a familiar name. Which now, most recent studies say, is effective in combating the virus. Three cents a pill. The drug companies don’t like three cents a pill. Three cents a pill is what it costs. But recent studies have come out very strongly in favor.
Donald Trump: (18:28)
Twitter has censored users simply for using the term illegal alien, which it has labeled as hateful content. And just taking you off for whatever reason. You have to see the sentence they took me off for. It’s the most loving sentence. It’s really amazing. They could have done better, because I’ve had a lot of worse. I couldn’t believe that was the reason. Take a look at it. You know exactly the sentence I’m talking of. It’s become very famous. People are saying, “Really?” Even the other side said, “Really?”
Donald Trump: (19:04)
And of course there is no better evidence that big tech is out of control than the fact that they banned the sitting president of the United States earlier this year. A ban that continues to this day. Continues. So we get the word out, but it’s not a fair situation. Very, very bad for this country. Very bad for the world. If they can do it to me, they can do it to anyone. And in fact that is exactly what they’re doing. They’re taking people off who don’t even realize they were taken off. They’d have no idea why they were taken off. But what they are doing is incredible and incredibly dangerous.
Donald Trump: (19:42)
Joining us this morning are just a few of the many Americans who have been illegally banned or silenced under the corrupt regime of censorship. These brave patriots are included in the lawsuit and thousands more are joining as we speak. Thousands more. They’re all wanting to join. This will be, I think will go down as the biggest class action ever filed, because thousands of people want to join. Jen Horton is a schoolteacher from Fenton, Michigan. Earlier this year, she was kicked off Facebook for sharing a post questioning whether young children should be required to wear masks. She had a question. Giving both sides and actually not negative, just giving both sides. That was enough. At the same time, as Jen was de-platformed, her brother had gone missing and she was unable to get the word out to all of her followers. She had a lot of followers. Could not get the word out. And Jen, I want to thank you very much for being here and stepping forward. It takes a lot of courage. Would you like to come up and say something? Jen? Where’s Jen?
Speaker 1: (21:04)
She’s right there.
Donald Trump: (21:06)
Jen. Please. Thank you. Thank you.
Jen Horton: (21:09)
I just appreciate the opportunity to be here with all of these amazing patriots and I thank you, President Trump, for everything you’re doing for us.
Donald Trump: (21:18)
Thank you Jen very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jen.
Donald Trump: (21:26)
Dr. Kelly Victory. I love that name. I would have gone with that name if I had the choice. Is a board certified trauma and emergency specialist from Colorado. Great person who was asked by the pastor of a church to prepare a video about how to mitigate risks of the China virus to allow church services to safely resume. Just a question. Could you give us some information? The video was outrageously removed from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube with horrible statements being made by them. Kelly, thank you for your bravery. Please say a few words. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (22:10)
She was delayed. Her flight was delayed.
Donald Trump: (22:15)
Oh. Facebook delayed the flight. The flight’s delayed by four hours. I wonder. I can’t believe that. That’s terrible. What they will do. All right. Thank you, anywhere. There he is landing. Going into Newark. Kelly [inaudible 00:22:40] and Bobby Michael, are angel parents. Their precious son Brandon was killed at just 21 years of age by a twice deported and very violent illegal alien. He caused a very fatal collision. Something should have never happened. Since then, they have heroically launched their own deeply personal fight to draw attention to the dangers of illegal immigration. They helped push through Florida’s ban on deadly sanctuary cities and they are indeed deadly. And they continue to be strong advocates for border security and immigration enforcement, but they have been cruelly and unfairly banned from Twitter. Would you like to say a few words? Where are you?
Speaker 2: (23:37)
Right here.
Donald Trump: (23:38)
Would you please?
Kelly: (23:40)
Thank you Mr. President. The fight for citizenship must continue. We are in this. We will not allow our nation to be silenced. We stand together and we thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (23:56)
Great. Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: (23:58)
Well said.
Bobby: (23:58)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (24:01)
Beautiful. I see somebody running for office very soon.
Donald Trump: (24:03)
I see somebody running for office very soon. That was great. I want to thank you very much. It’s really terrific.
Donald Trump: (24:10)
We’re in a fight. We’re in a fight that we’re going to win. We’re in a fight that people want us to take on. So many people have said to me, please sir, do something about big tech. Sue them sir, sue them and they’ve been saying it to me for a long time, but there has never been a better time to do it. Polling released by Scott Rasmussen, highly respected, shows that nearly two thirds of Americans believe big tech companies should be required to abide by the first amendment guarantee of free speech and I think those numbers are low, very low. 68% of Americans believe social media companies should prioritize their fair treatment of every citizen over protecting themselves. They want people protected. They want people to have their voice and an overwhelming majority believe that tech giants have become too powerful. They’ve crossed the line many, many times and by far too much.
Donald Trump: (25:11)
The American people’s birthright of freedom must prevail against big tech and other forces that seek to destroy it. Through this lawsuit, we are standing up for American democracy, by standing up for free speech rights of every American, Democrat, Republican, independent, whoever it may be. This lawsuit is just the beginning. It’s a very big suit with great lawyers. I’ll let you know about that in about a year from now. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but I don’t think so. They’ve had a tremendous track record in doing good. We’ll also take this battle to the state legislatures, to Congress and ultimately to the ballot box and it will be a very popular one at the ballot box. I will never stop fighting to defend constitutional rights and sacred liberties of the American people. I will never stop. I will now ask John Coale and Pam Bondi, two terrific people that love our country so much, to step forward and discuss the suit and then we’ll take a few questions. Thank you very much.
John Coale: (26:34)
Hello. He’s taller than me. This suit is really about freedom of speech. It’s basic that freedom of speech depends on certain things. One is, who decides what’s hate? Who decides what’s misinformation? It’s not a couple guys out in California. It’s always been the Supreme Court for over 200 years and I would say, they’ve done a heck of a job. We’re taking this suit. We’re going to prove that they are government actors, therefore the first amendment does apply and we think we will be victorious on that. We think that we’re in the right area, which is southern Florida and you have to understand that we can’t let this happen because for all you out there who are Democrats and liberals or whatever you are, you’re next. Now it’s the conservatives, but as history shows of, it will turn. Maybe five years from now, maybe three months from now, maybe 10 years, but you’re next.
John Coale: (27:49)
I would urge people from the other side of President Trump’s political party to join us because you can’t have this going on. One last thing, the most hated thing by all the Supreme courts over all the years is called prior restraint. That means that you can’t speak, Pentagon papers is the famous case. You can’t do this because we say so. The Supreme court hates this. They think it’s the worst kind of censorship we have and when this gentlemen can not go on and say what he wants to say, that’s prior restraint, every minute of every day until this thing gets resolved. Thank you.
Pam Bondi: (28:43)
I’m here, not as part of that great legal team over there, but I’m very proud to be part of America First Policy constitutional litigation team. I was here just to explain just a few things and you know what John said, this is about our constitution. This isn’t just for conservatives. This is for our media. This is for everyone out there about censorship. This is for Democrats and even progressive’s who speech should be protected under the first amendment. If you recall, Tulsi Gabbard she sued. Do you remember that? Tulsi Gabbard was censored when she was running for president and so she sued. People say that they have immunity, they meaning YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, under section 230. Well, here’s where that’s changed. Section 230 came about in 1996 and it was an offshoot of the Decency Act to protect really, to protect against children being exploited online. That’s what this was all about.
Pam Bondi: (29:45)
Take it back to ’96. How many users were there then? Probably about 20 million on AOL, right president? 1996. Now what do we have? Facebook, Twitter, we have billions world wide. Times have changed. The internet is flourishing, but first amendment still must be protected. No one could envision what was about to happen with the internet and our country now with billions, billions of users worldwide. That’s why this is so important. When you have Mark Zuckerberg and others being called in front of Congress and being coerced and being questioned by all these congressmen, then you also have Mark Zuckerberg emailing with Dr. Fauci about COVID and in fact, a lot of their emails that we received have been redacted, not just because of phone numbers, but because they were trading trade secrets. A private company is communicating with the federal government and parts of that were redacted. They’re not immune anymore. They are not immune anymore. It was coercion, collusion, working together and they cannot hide from the first amendment. That’s why this is so very, very important.
Pam Bondi: (31:09)
Even Facebook’s oversight board, that Mark Zuckerberg created, the oversight board came back and said there were problems. There were problems and it lacked consistently being applied to everyone by community standards. That’s why this is so important for us, for our future, for all political parties, for all human beings around the world. We believe in the first amendment and America First Policy will fight for it. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (31:40)
Thank you very much. A lot of people ask me about Dr. Fauci. I like Dr. Fauci. I actually get along with him great, but they said, why didn’t you fire him? I said, no, he was good. He’d recommend something, I’d do the opposite and we always turned out to be right. Sir, don’t close the borders to China. We closed them very early. Get no credit for anything, but these are minor details. Any questions? Christina, yes. I chose you. Go ahead please.
Christina: (32:10)
Thank you sir. What is the possibility of a settlement prior to trial? Obviously any court ruling in your favor and you’ve laid out a very compelling case. Anything prior to a court ruling would certainly limit the rest, everybody else who’s not in the class.
Donald Trump: (32:26)
We’re not looking for a settlement. We don’t expect a settlement. They fight and they fight hard. They’ve never had anything like this and they’ve never had a team of very attractive looking people in every way. Look at that. That’s a quite a legal team. That’s like from a picture, but they are very effective, much more importantly, legal team. We’re not looking to settle. We don’t know what’s going to happen, but we’re not looking to settle. Thank you, Christina.
Christina: (32:49)
Thank you sir.
Donald Trump: (32:50)
Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 3: (32:54)
We’re talking privately held companies that have been censoring. What’s your position on public broadcasting, NPR, who also seem to be filling the same kind of role for-
Donald Trump: (33:04)
It’s such a great question. They are terrible. They are terrible. It’s not only what they say, it’s what they don’t say. For instance, I was informed that there are record numbers of murders took place this weekend. Record numbers. They don’t even talk about it on NBC and CBS and ABC and NPR. They don’t talk about it and it’s a big story. That’s why the credibility of the mainstream media is the lowest it’s ever been. Lowest it’s ever been. I hate to take credit for this, but I’m very proud of the fact that I exposed them for what they are. They are terrible, terrible representatives of our country. They don’t talk about crime. They don’t talk about Chicago where you had 260 people shot this weekend. In Afghanistan we didn’t lose one soldier in the last more than a year. I will say that was largely because of me, but I won’t take credit, but the good news is I will never be given credit either, but we haven’t lost a soldier. Think of it. 260 people shot in Chicago, massive numbers of people shot in New York and they don’t prosecute these people. These are killers. They don’t prosecute these people. They only go after Republicans. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening in our country and a very dangerous thing and a very good question. Please, please.
Speaker 4: (34:36)
How you doing? How do you fight the argument that these are private companies? They can be as liberal as they want to be.
Donald Trump: (34:41)
Well, they say that they’re private, but they’re no longer private. If they gave up their section 230 liability protection, I would go along with them. I’d say that private. We’ll open up other privates and other privates will be opened up. I mean, I know that for a fact because I’m involved in that, but I will say that they have section 230. It’s a liability protection, the likes of which nobody in the history of our country has ever received, just as small group and we’re not going to stand for it and that makes them, in my opinion, very subject to the kind of penalties that we’re talking about, which is potentially, John, trillions of dollars. It’s a number that the likes of which nobody’s seen before. John, you might want to address that.
John Coale: (35:25)
The Supreme Court over the years, especially recently, has been very clear what you can and can’t do as a private company. They’ve done it all. There’s mainly three reasons. The president has talked about the immunity. There’s also the coercion by Congress, Congressman, Congresswomen, in the media and in testimony and in their tweets. There’s also the fact that when this law was passed, Zuckerberg was in middle school. It has served its purpose.
John Coale: (36:03)
It’s a middle school, okay? It has served its purpose. Now it has grown into this monster that Congress never intended. And the real bottom line is Congress cannot delegate what it can’t do itself. And that’s what they’ve done.
Pam Bondi: (36:23)
We were talking earlier about when 230 was created in 1996 and really I believe one of the main reasons was something we all care deeply about. But as a former attorney general getting the sex predators off instantly. Yet today there are still… This may have come out during the congressional testimony, but there are still there were over 16 million reports still of sex predators, of sex exploitation of children online. 45 million photos and videos that are allegedly still out there. That’s what they need to be focusing on.
Speaker 5: (37:09)
Thank you, Mr. President. I think the timing of this is perfect, especially going to the midterms and looking ahead to 2024. Can you share your thoughts on the timing of it and how this decision can help protect conservative viewpoints as we move further to 2024 elections?
Donald Trump: (37:25)
The timing just seemed to be right, because they’ve been so abusive, so bad what they’ve done. Not only to the president of the United States, but to so many others. Hamas has a site. The greatest killers in the world have a site. They are never reprimanded, they are never red-flagged. Nothing ever happens. And again, get the quote you won’t believe it, but these people call for the destruction of Israel, the destruction of the USA, nothing happens to them. And I just think its become so flagrant and so outrageous and outrageously ridiculous that this was a good time. Not having to do with the elections, I think this will go on beyond the elections. I would be surprised if it didn’t. But I think it’s a very important thing for our nation. Very, very important. Yeah please go ahead, please.
Speaker 6: (38:17)
Just to clarify, who should be the arbiter of what’s hate, what’s offensive, what should not be published? What goes beyond free speech? And because so much of this your banning has to do with comments you made around January 6th, just to clarify further, what did you do to stop the insurrection as some people call it and why were you not able to stop it?
Donald Trump: (38:41)
So that whole event, unfortunate event just went through Congress and a report was issued and my name wasn’t even mentioned. And I appreciate that. I was surprised frankly because I would have assumed that they would have come up with their typically biased, at least on the Democrat side statement. The report came out as you saw it two weeks ago. My name wasn’t even mentioned, that was an unfortunate event. I say though however, people are being treated unbelievably unfairly. When you look at people in prison and nothing happens to Antifa and they burned down cities and killed people. There were no guns in the Capitol except for the gun that shot Ashli Babbitt. And nobody knows who that men were.
Donald Trump: (39:26)
If that were the opposite way that man would be all over, he would be the most well-known and I believe I can say man, because I believe I know exactly who it is. But he would be the most well known person in this country, in the world. But the person that shot Ashli Babbitt right through the head, just boom. There was no reason for that. And why isn’t that person being opened up and why isn’t that being studied? They’ve already written it off. They said that case is closed. If that were the opposite, that case would be going on for years and years and it would not be pretty. So I just thought this was a very important time. Yeah please go ahead. Go ahead please.
Speaker 7: (40:12)
If you’re successful with this and Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and all of the social media platforms let you back on and let everyone else back on uninhibited the way that everyone’s supposed to have access, would you use their platforms again?
Donald Trump: (40:25)
I don’t know. That’s a good question. I don’t know I might not. I’m in a different position because if I put out a press release, I’m getting extremely good pickup, but that’s me. The world, everybody that’s getting banned they can’t put out a press release. People would say who the hell is that? Nobody’s going to pick it up. And even myself I could instantaneously get the word out. If somebody says a lie, like the fake media, I can at least give the opposing side which I’ve been doing for six years. I used to get great publicity before I ran for office. I’ve been doing this for five or six years where I can get a word out an opposing word, today you can’t do that. They took away the rights of in my opinion the majority, I really believe it’s the majority because people aren’t for all of these things.
Donald Trump: (41:14)
Now they have voter ID. That’s another one when you talk about voter ID all of a sudden they love voter ID. They fought it vehemently. I noticed two days ago, I watched a congressmen happened to be from South Carolina saying “No, I’ve always been in favor of voter ID.” Well, he hasn’t because you look at his statement for the last two years he’s been vehemently opposed, but now they lie like nobody has ever lied. I watched him say, “I’ve always believed in voter ID essentially.” And I said that’s unbelievable. Fortunately the particular newscast had his statements from before of which they were too numerous to put up, but they put up enough of them. But the Democrats are now saying because they saw it was an 88% positive issue. They’re now saying we believe in voter ID, we have to have voter ID. There isn’t one Democrat in the country that said that.
Donald Trump: (42:07)
And in a year from now the fake news will say they’ve always been on this side, it’s amazing. If you say it long enough, hard enough, often enough people will start to believe it. That’s what happened with Russia, that’s what happened with Ukraine. That’s what happened with… Well, the worst is when they don’t say it like the laptop from hell. They didn’t want it. You look at that thing there is more criminal activity on that laptop than Al Capone had if he ever had a laptop. We’d like to give Al Capone one, but he was a baby compared to what I was able to see. Brooke would you like to say a few more words?
Speaker 8: (42:47)
What’s going to happen if somebody joined the lawsuit?
Donald Trump: (42:48)
That’s a good question, Brooke.
Brooke Rollins: (42:50)
You can join the law suit by going to takeonbigtech.com. I did not plant that question, but I very much appreciate it. Takeonbigtech.com and we really are looking for the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Americans. And let me just say one quick thing. It was a great question about the political ramifications of this lawsuit versus two years or four years. And certainly it will be part of the national narrative I think moving forward for the next couple of years. But this effort really is about the battle for the future of this country. And when we lose the opportunity to be part of a public discourse, whether as conservatives, as Republicans, as libertarians, as fighting against critical race theory, as questioning masks and whether our 11, 13, 15 and 16 year olds, my children should be forced to wear a mask all day.
Brooke Rollins: (43:40)
Whether we’re questioning illegal immigration and how to use that, that’s crazy and it’s not okay and this is not America. And it is not the America that I know we all want for our children and our future grandchildren. And that’s what this lawsuit is about. We have the best legal team in the country. The America First Policy Institute is partnering with them to ensure that the word gets out, that we can truly truly give our Americans who have been censored, who have been compromised, who have been told that they don’t have a voice that will no longer be the case. So thank you. Thank you all
John Coale: (44:15)
I want to make one thing, the gentleman asked who would decide what’s hate speech, who would decide this thing. For 200 years, over 200 years it’s been the Supreme court. We can’t let it be in the hands of unelected people or unappointed justices. But they have done such a good job for 200 years on this issue. We don’t need any panels. We don’t need any oversight committees. We need the Supreme court and the judicial system to come into the 21st century.
Donald Trump: (44:52)
So I want to thank everybody. It’s about 94 degrees out. I’m sorry to do this. It was supposed to be a beautiful day, 72 and perfect and it’s a little bit hot. We’re going to have refreshments, drinks we’ll bring you into the club house if you’d like. But we’ll take care of you because I see some of you are in serious trouble sitting there. I do hope I could leave you with two things. Number one, this is a very important lawsuit. This is a big time long awaited, very, very long awaited. The complexity of it I guess took a longer period of time, but other litigants also want to join in with us and we have great confidence in the courts and we’re going to see what happens. And the other thing I just asked the mainstream media to go back and do on network news and everywhere else please discuss the horrors of what’s going on in… Out in Chicago. It’s a number. It’s a stat put out by the city over the weekend. There’s no war that we lost that many and for a long time and many people died, young people. And New York is a horror show. New York has the worst crime wave that they’ve had ever and nothing’s done about it, except no bail. They let everybody out of prison.
Donald Trump: (46:23)
They just left almost 500 people out. They let them all out. They caused tremendous damage and harm and physical harm to other people and death. And they let them out. If the people don’t hear this you’ll never be able to solve the problem. It’s a problem like this country has never had. What’s happened over the last six months in particular and what’s happening in certain cities is a horrible thing. It’s an embarrassment to our country, but more importantly it’s just a horrible thing. The loss of human life on a weekly basis and you turn on these major newscasts that a lot of people are watching and it’s not even mentioned. You have to change. You got to get you credibility back. You don’t have the credibility, you have to get it back. I want to thank everybody very much and we’ll be seeing what happens. John good luck, Pam good luck, everybody. Trish I want to thank you for being so great. You’re really fantastic. I appreciate it very much. You’ve been so incredible. Thank you. And thank you-

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA-
Donald Trump: (00:00)
Wow. Thank you.
Audience: (02:10)
… USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, [crosstalk 00:02:10]-
Donald Trump: (02:10)
Well, I want to thank Ohio for the incredible turnout, there’s thousands of people trying to get in, and all of the unbelievable, hardworking patriots who are here tonight at the very first rally of the 2022 election. We’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the Senate. With your help, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats. And we have no choice. You know that, right? We have no choice. And we’re going to elect an amazing slate of proud American first Republicans next year,
Donald Trump: (02:55)
America first. You never used to hear that expression, did you? You hear it plenty now. After just five months, the Biden administration is already a complete and total catastrophe. I told you, crime is surging. Murders are soaring. Police departments are being gutted. Illegal aliens are overrunning their borders. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. Our poor borders, they were so perfect, they were so good.
Donald Trump: (03:32)
Drug cartels and human traffickers are back in business. Like they’ve never been before. They’re doing numbers that they’ve never even thought possible. And just a few short months ago, drugs were way down. Human trafficking was way down. It was all way down. They had to do is go away for a little while. It was beautiful.
Donald Trump: (03:55)
But the schools, when you take a look at schools, and you look at all of the things that happen, left-wing indoctrination camps, critical race theory is being forced on our military, gas prices are spiking, inflation is skyrocketing and China, Russia and Iran are humiliating our country.
Donald Trump: (04:22)
Joe Biden is destroying our nation right before our very own eyes. The number one priority for everyone who wants to save America is to pour every single ounce of energy you have into winning a gigantic victory in the midterms. And in 2024, together, we will send Joe Biden and the fake news media …
Donald Trump: (04:57)
There’s a lot of people back there. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Do you miss me? They miss me. They miss me. I know. They look at their bad ratings, and they’re saying, “We miss this guy.” I said it was going to happen. I was waiting for them to endorse me actually. I know that was a big step, but they’re going down the tubes. Their numbers are very bad.
Donald Trump: (05:32)
But together, we will send Biden and the media and all of the people that are so bad to our country, big tech tyrants, a message they cannot ever censor, cancel or ignore. We will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon. There is no more dire threat today than the crisis on our Southern border, other than perhaps our elections. That’s a dire threat. That’s probably the biggest threat of all. Isn’t it? What happened in the election, it’s a disgrace. But we’ll be talking about that, unless you’d rather not have me talk about it. Would you rather talk about it? I had a feeling.
Donald Trump: (06:28)
Immediately upon taking office Joe Biden deliberately and systematically through his people, because I don’t think he did it, dismantled America’s border defenses and incited a flood of illegal migrants like this country has never seen. They violated our laws from every single corner of the globe. They were invited in, and we can’t do that. We can’t afford it. We can’t have it. We can’t have people coming out of prisons. We have no idea who they are.
Donald Trump: (07:05)
Illegal border crossings are now up 976% since just a short few months ago. When I left office, we gave the new administration the most secure Southern border our country had ever seen by far. We ended the ridiculous catch and release. You know what that is. You catch them, and you release them into our country. A brilliant policy, and they’re back at that now. We ended asylum fraud. We built almost 500 miles of very beautiful, very successful wall that was working, and it would’ve …
Donald Trump: (07:52)
Oh, thank you. That’s a friend of mine. He’s a conductor. What a beautiful sound. By the way, I have to say, I have to say, just driving over here, it was a 30 minute drive from the airport. The farms, the houses, the lawns are all beautiful. It looks like you cut your lawns every day. You have no crime. You have no murders. You have no muggings.
Donald Trump: (08:23)
I said to a couple of the law enforcement people, who are phenomenal, by the way, I said, ” What are the crime stats here? Let me guess. There’s not a lot of it.” He said, “Sir, there isn’t.” But every lawn was so beautiful. Every farm was perfect. The barns were painted. The place is gorgeous. And thank you for letting us win on November 3rd, the great state of Ohio, in a record number, a record number. We won a lot of places that people haven’t figured out yet, but actually most of them have.
Donald Trump: (09:02)
We empowered ICE to do their jobs. We worked to cancel down on sanctuary cities. We did a number on sanctuary cities. We want to cancel sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cities take care of many, many criminals. They’re very dangerous places. Even in California, they really want sanctuary cities out. But for some reason, the politicians don’t. Didn’t they send out 38 million ballots in California? I wonder what the real vote in California would be.
Donald Trump: (09:41)
And we crushed the very vicious thugs known as MS-13. Under my administration, when an illegal alien trespassed across our borders, we caught them. We detained them, and we rapidly threw them the hell out of our country. And we did it by the thousands.
Donald Trump: (10:07)
And once we got the word out, people didn’t come. It wasn’t really that big a deal, people just didn’t come. Once he came in and he said, We want everybody to come in,” oh, that was a disaster.
Donald Trump: (10:18)
By the way, not the numbers they report. Remember they’re fake news. You have millions of people coming into this country. You have millions of people coming into our country. We have no idea who they are. Joe Biden is doing the exact opposite as we did. His policies to make illegal immigration as easy as possible, instituting catch and release, ripping apart our asylum agreements, ordering a stop in … Could you see this? A stop order. Any contractors here? Do you ever get a stop order?
Donald Trump: (10:51)
We had the biggest stop order the world has ever seen. We stopped finishing the wall. We stopped working on the wall. Now they want to finish the wall. And the contractors are saying, “How much are you going to pay us?” They have to start all over again. I want to just congratulate those contractors. They’re going to make a fortune.
Donald Trump: (11:12)
They crippled ICE and the border patrol. I’ll tell you what, border patrol, these are incredible people, ICE. They’re incredible people. I wouldn’t want the job. I wouldn’t want it. You have some very tough people in this audience. I can’t see anybody that would do that job very well, let me just say. It’s a rough job. They run into a pack. They call it a pack. They run into a pack of MS-13, and they start swinging, and they start swinging heart. And in the end, they win. They’re tough. They’re smart. And you know what? They love our country. And somebody has to do that work.
Donald Trump: (11:49)
For the last three months, more than anything that you’ve ever seen, the illegal alien minors have arrived at our border. These are just wonderful kids. And they are coming in at levels that we’ve never seen. And then they’re sent around all over this country. All over the country, they’re sent. And right now, I just heard for the first time, who would even think it, but I heard for the first time they’re on suicide watch. So many of these young kids, they’re in suicide watch, all because of this stupid policy that you’ve been watching over the last few months. Kids are on suicide watch. Think of that.
Donald Trump: (12:32)
Biden has violated his constitutional oath, endangered our safety. And look, he surrendered our, really, if you think of it, no matter how you cover it, sovereignty. What he’s done to our nation is unthinkable in a short period of time. And I said that was going to happen. I said it was going to happen. We need a Republican Congress to shut down the lawless Biden agenda. And it is a lawless agenda. We have to defund his reckless immigration policies and restore our nation’s Southern border to where it was.
Audience: (13:29)
Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, [crosstalk 00:13:45]-
Donald Trump: (13:44)
Thank you very much. Did you ever hear the expression that the vote-counter is sometimes much more important than the candidate? Did you ever hear that expression? Think about that, because what happened on November 3rd was a disgrace. On the evening of November 3rd, the election was over, and then all of a sudden things started closing down all over in certain states. Not in other states. Didn’t happen in Ohio, but it happened in certain swing states. And we took a massive victory they did into something that should never be allowed.
Donald Trump: (14:28)
Kamala Harris, your vice-president, only went to the border yesterday for the one simple reason, because I announced that I was going next [inaudible 00:14:43], and I am. At the request of [inaudible 00:14:50] border patrol, I’m going to the next week. Oh, if I didn’t do that, I don’t know if she was ever going to go. I really don’t know if it … Was she ever going to go? I don’t know.
Donald Trump: (14:58)
The radical left Democrats [inaudible 00:15:02] call it whatever you want is also contributing to massive crime. Other countries are emptying their prisons into the United States. You know that, right? They’re emptying, they’re opening their prisons. Why should they have these killers, these drug dealers, these traffickers? And they traffic in women, by the way, mostly. They traffic in women. Why should they have them? Why should they feed them? Why should they have to watch them? And they’re very dangerous. Let’s send them to the United States. We’ll put them in the caravans, and they’ll get in, because nobody even checks who’s coming into our country. It’s insanity. And it’s destroying our country, destroying our country.
Donald Trump: (15:46)
They are, they’re murders and drug dealers, and nobody’s ever seen anything like it, what’s happening. Just this month, a previously deported illegal alien in Massachusetts, with prior charges for murder and many other things, gunned down a man in broad daylight, shooting him viciously and violently, as he lay in the street, four times.
Donald Trump: (16:12)
Recently in Louisiana, great place, an illegal alien, who entered the country as an unaccompanied minor under Obama, was charged with hacking a woman and their 15-year-old sister into very small pieces with a machete and stabbing two other people to death. And right here in Ohio, a twice deported fugitive MS-13 gang member, the worst anywhere in the world, and we’ve taken out thousands and thousands and now they want to let them come back, he was charged with murder. He was discovered in Galloway after entering our country for a third time and bad things happened.
Donald Trump: (17:04)
And when I came up tonight, I had so many people, they said, “Could you do us a favor?” “What?” “Could you talk the snake?” You remember the snake? I used to use it on occasion. Not often. Does anybody want to hear the snake? You want to hear it? The snake, the snake. The snake. And this has to do with our border, wasn’t meant to be for the border. It was meant to be for other reasons, but this has to be really what’s happening to our border.
Donald Trump: (17:43)
And so many people said, “Please, please, you’re going to Ohio.” I don’t know the fact that I’m going to Ohio, why they want to talk about the snake, but it’s because of immigration. And it’s because of the borders and because Ohio sees it far better than most. Don’t you, huh? You understand what’s happening. The snake.
Donald Trump: (18:06)
On her way to work one morning down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored. Skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in, and I’ll take care of you,” to the snake. “Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in oh, tender woman,” sighed the vicious snake.
Donald Trump: (18:37)
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night. And as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been fully, fully revived.
Donald Trump: (19:00)
” Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful,” she cried, “But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, you truly would have died.” She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying, “Thank you,” the snake gave her a vicious bite.
Donald Trump: (19:35)
“Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” sighed vicious snake. “I saved you cried the woman, and you’ve been in me, but why? You know your bite is poisonous, and now I’m going to die.” “Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin, “You knew well I was a snake before you took me in.”
Donald Trump: (20:17)
That’s the way it is. That’s the way it is. That’s the way it is. We’re taking in killers. We’re taking in all of these horrible people. Good people are coming in, but horrible, horrible people. Again, remember that term, they’re emptying their prisons. And if you were heading those countries, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and many others, including middle Eastern countries, by the way, that’s how they come in. Remember the snake.
Donald Trump: (20:49)
In the Republican party, we do not believe that violent criminals should be welcomed into our country with open arms. We believe that they should be promptly deported or put behind bars. And that’s what I did during my administration at a level that nobody’s ever seen it.
Donald Trump: (21:09)
The radical left Democrats are doing everything possible to put your family in grave danger. I don’t know if they’re doing it out of naivete or are they doing it because they think it’s really good to have all these people coming into our country. But they are putting your family into a very, very bad position, releasing criminal aliens, defunding the police abolishing cash bail.
Donald Trump: (21:38)
Look at New York, what’s happened to our poor New York. Crime is through the roof. Never been anything like it. Murders through the roof. The police are doing so much, but they’re not given authority to do anything more. They want to solve the problem. New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, they have great police forces. They’re not allowed to do their job. And now they’re all leaving. That’s going to be a real problem when they realize we need them to help us, and they’re not going to be there any longer.
Donald Trump: (22:14)
They all try and take away your guns. And that’s what they’re doing. And if you remember, when I was campaigning against Joe Biden, I said, they’re going to take away your guns. Your Second Amendment is under siege.
Donald Trump: (22:25)
In Chicago, which is the single most dangerous city, large scale, has the strongest gun laws in the country, they even say the strongest gun laws in the world. And yet people are being shot by the thousands every year, worse than Afghanistan. How about that? Worse than Afghanistan, where, by the way, I started the process. All the troops are coming back home. They couldn’t stop the process.
Donald Trump: (22:53)
21 years is enough. Don’t we think? 21 years. They couldn’t stop the process. They wanted to, but it was very tough to stop the process when other things…yeah. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a shame. 21 years, by a government that wouldn’t last. The only way they last is if we’re there. What are we going to say? We’ll stay for another 21 years, then we’ll stay for another 50. The whole thing is ridiculous. So we’re bringing our troops back home from Iraq. We’re bringing troops come from Afghanistan. We brought them back home from Syria.
Donald Trump: (23:29)
Remember the thousands of troops we had on the border with Syria? Remember that? We had thousands of trips between Turkey and Syria. I said, “Wait a minute. This border has been here for a thousand years plus. We never did anything. Now, why are we doing it?” “Sir? Can’t do it. It’ll be war. It’ll be war.”
Donald Trump: (23:48)
I said, “Our troops are in grave danger.” You have two armies, and you have our troops in the middle. So I started bringing them home. And then we got down to 54 troops. And I said to one of the generals who was a good general, he wasn’t a woke general. Do you notice the woke generals we have? This was a real general. I said, “We have 54 men from 5,000. We have 54 men on the border. Are they in danger?” Said, “Sir, you have 54 men between two armies. They don’t have a chance. They’re going to be target practice.”
Donald Trump: (24:20)
I said, “Get them the hell out.” And everybody said, “What a terrible thing he did.” And you know what? That was three years ago. And nothing happened. They protect their own border. Pretty amazing, right? Pretty amazing. But you’ll never hear that from the fake news, or many other things that turned out to be right.
Donald Trump: (24:36)
If you care about the security of your family, if you care about the safety of your community, if you care about law and order, law and order in the great state of Ohio. Now you do. I met a lot of your law enforcement people outside. They’re incredible people. They’re patriots. They’re patriots. One of them came out …
Donald Trump: (25:03)
They’re Patriots. One of them came out, and I shouldn’t say this, but look, I met so many, but one of them came out. There’s tears in his eyes. This guy hasn’t cried in a very long time. But just in meeting because I represent what they want. They want law and they want order. And that’s what you want. That’s what this country wants. So you have to deliver massive majorities for Republicans in Congress. Next year, you have to do it right here in Ohio’s 16th congressional district, you have the opportunity to elect an incredible patriot to Congress who I know very well. He grew up in this area. Believe it or not, he’s not a carpetbagger, like so many. A lot of them say, “Sir, I’m running for Congress.”
Donald Trump: (25:51)
“Oh, good. How long have you lived there?”
Donald Trump: (25:52)
“Well, actually I moved there last week. I saw an opening.” Max Miller. You know Max? Great guy. He loves our country. He loves the people of Ohio. And Max was a trusted aide of mine in the White House. We had great people working for me. We had some real losers too, by the way. But that can happen when I didn’t know too many people. In Washington, I was there 17 times in my life, and all of a sudden the President of the United States. So we met a couple, but do I know the people? Do I know the good ones? I know the good ones. But we had some really great people. And Max was one of them. He did a fantastic job. He helped me with North Korea negotiation. And we did so much for Israel and Iraq and the G7, G20.
Donald Trump: (26:40)
We brought peace to the Middle East, if this guy would finish it. But now he’s going back to the Iran deal, which is going to destroy Israel, or there’s going to be a big war more likely. In Congress, Max will be tough on illegal immigration. He will be strong on crime, as strong as you can get. He will stand up to China, and he will protect Ohio jobs just like I did. Remember in Lima? Do you remember they were to close your tank plant, and I was president elect. I didn’t know anything about the tank plant, but I heard through a great gentleman. Did anybody ever hear of a man named Jim Jordan? Tremendous athlete, tremendous wrestler, all these wrestlers. They wanted to wrestle Jim, and they got their kicked every time. He hasn’t changed. Jim’s here by the way, so I’ll introduce him in a couple of minutes. But they wanted to close the tank plant.
Donald Trump: (27:45)
And I went to see it. Lima. I went to see it, and I couldn’t believe. Big, massive bled. The people that worked there were so talented. They have the turrets. I mean, the only thing you know about tanks is Dukakis, where he walked with the helmet. He wouldn’t have looked good in this tank either, but I see these tanks and I said to the guys, “Who’s going to make these? This is the only place in the country that made tanks. So I guess that means we’re going to have to buy them from China.” I said, “So who’s going to do this if you close this great facility?” The talent was incredible. The ball bearings that they made, every single one with love and with care, and that turret where you could flip it with your finger practically. It was just incredible technology. I said, “Who’s going to make our tanks?” And I ended that order. It was a stupid order. I ended it. And we now have that plant working overtime, making tanks and tanks and tanks. If we didn’t, you wouldn’t have a tank and believe it or not tanks are very important.
Donald Trump: (28:52)
Max’s opponent is a guy named Anthony Gonzales, who’s bad news. He’s a grandstanding RINO. Not respected in DC who voted for the unhinged, unconstitutional, illegal impeachment, witch hunt. The witch hunt. This guy used to call me and my people in the office, which said, “You know somebody named Gonzales?” I said, “No.”
Donald Trump: (29:20)
“He’s a Congressman from Ohio.” I said, “So what? Tell me about him. What’s his story?”
Donald Trump: (29:25)
“He wants to go to Ohio in Air Force One, because I was coming to Ohio.” I came to Ohio a lot. I feel very comfortable. I used to work in Ohio. I used to work in Cincinnati, Ohio. I love the queen city, Cincinnati. But he wanted to know if he could fly on Air Force One. With all the people in Congress, I think he was just about the only guy ever call. He heard I was going to Ohio. Could he fly back and forth in Air Force One.
Donald Trump: (29:50)
I said, “I don’t know. Who’s the guy? Tell me about him.” And I didn’t hear much good, but I said, “What the hell? He’s asking, so let them ride.” It holds like 400 people. So you put a guy in a seat, right? I didn’t get to know him too well, but I’d see him on the plane, and then I’d see him go back and then I’d be going three months later, and he’d call again. “Could I go to Ohio on Air Force One?” I put him on the plane. I rode him back. And the next thing I heard his name. Next time he was impeaching me.
Donald Trump: (30:19)
He was impeaching me. I don’t know. That’s not the reason I’m doing this, but I just thought it said, it’s a character trait that was not so good. Not so good. He’s a sellout. He’s a fake Republican and a disgrace to your state. I will tell you that. He’s not the candidate that you want representing the Republican Party. He’s the candidate of Liz Cheney. That’s another beauty. Liz Cheney. Mitt Romney. Do you notice the Democrats have horrible policy, right? Defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, all of their cancel culture. Let’s cancel out George Washington. You see that? They’re after George Washington now. I did say two years ago, they may go there. If you’re not strong, they going to go there. But he’s a candidate. He works. He likes Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden.
Donald Trump: (31:25)
Earlier this year, Gonzalez voted to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Okay? I thought we were trying to go the opposite way so that we can have our country back and have our borders back. He voted to keep our troops bogged down in Syria, and I got them out. We didn’t listen to them too much. Not too many people do. After he voted for impeachment, the Ohio GOP censured Gonzalez and remanded him to you know where, but they demanded that he resign and resign immediately, and he’s still hanging in there. Every single Republican needs to vote him out of office and nominate and vote for a really great guy, Max Miller, a passion. He’s got a passion for this country like you wouldn’t believe. Max, come on up and say, hello. This is your territory, Max. Max Miller.
Max Miller: (32:47)
All right. Let’s hear it for the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. That’s right. And come 2024, we’re going to get them elected for the third time. That’s right, this guy. There is no greater fighter that this country has ever had, and I have never had a greater role model than President Donald J. Trump, period. Bar none. I need all of your help to get RINO, turncoat Tony out of office. And to help put an America first conservative into office for the 16th district. God bless you all. God bless President Trump. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (33:47)
Thank you, Max. Great guy. I can tell you.He’s a great guy. Also with us, another outstanding candidate for Congress. He’s right now, I just saw a poll. Max is doing great, and he’s doing great, and his race is very soon. He’s filling a seat, and I think he’s going to win. He’s going to win big. I see there’s like 12 candidates, and we endorsed them a couple of weeks ago and now he’s leading by a lot, and he’s a wonderful man. I’ve known him for a long time. Mike Carey. Mike, where are you, mike? Where’s Mike? Come here, Mike. Come here. Don’t keep them long, Mike, but say hello. So August 3rd, right Mike? August 3rd you’re running. Right? So that’s sooner than Max. Mike, you got to win, Mike.
Mike Carey: (34:36)
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank all of you. With his endorsement, the America first agenda, we are now leading by double digits. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank all of you and God bless America.
Donald Trump: (35:00)
Thank you, Mike. He’s doing a fantastic job. He had a tremendous career, and he’s now doing this, and it’s going to be a big winner. Both of these people. This is what we need. We’re also thrilled to be joined by a person who’s actually loved. You don’t necessarily hear that. But she’s loved and respected, and she’s tough and smart and kind. And kind. And she’s got such great common sense. Representative Marjorie Taylor Green. Where is she? She’s a fighter. She’s a fighter.
Donald Trump: (35:50)
And another one, we just mentioned his name, but I’ll mention it again. Come up here, Jim Jordan, come up. Jim Jordan. This guy. You are so lucky to have him in Ohio. That’s all I can say. Come here, Jim.
Jim Jordan: (36:27)
Thank you, Mr. President. They’ve already heard from me. They want to hear from you. Mostly what they want is for you to run in 2024 and go back to the White House. Thank you all very much.
Donald Trump: (36:56)
Some of the congressmen and senators, Capitol Hill, they said, “You got to see this guy working out.” They work out. They’re not in good shape. They never were. They were never athletes or anything. And he was a champion, NCA champ. He was one of the greats, and he works out and they say, “You wouldn’t believe this guy. He burns out the machines.” The machines are catching. They’re like burning out. They’re smoking. But the reason he never wears a jacket, because he’s in great shape. Okay? He’s in great shape. I say, “Jim, you ever wear a jacket?” No, he feels comfortable this way. Me, I’d rather wear a jacket. Most of you I think would rather wear a jacket, but he’s a great person. He’s tough and he’s smart. And he’s incredible. So thank you both and Marjorie, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (37:45)
North Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who’s been terrific. Where’s Kristi? Thank you, Kristi. Doing a great job. Kristi called me two years ago. She said, “Sir, do you think we could have fireworks” at those magnificent faces. I love those faces. Do you think my face will ever be [inaudible 00:38:16]? They all said, “He wants it. No. Let’s leave it the way it is.” But she called, “Could we have fireworks?” Right? And I said, “What’s the problem?”
Donald Trump: (38:26)
“They won’t approve it.” The Democrats, they wouldn’t approve. For years and years and years. I said, “Is there anything that can burn?”
Donald Trump: (38:31)
“No.” You know, stone? I said, “What’s the problem?” They just won’t give it. So we gave it, and we had a night to remember, right? Remember that? That was something. And the Democrats just announced that they’re canceling it for the people of South Dakota. They’re canceling it. I don’t know. They’re canceling it. So you have some other alternatives, but nothing could be like those nights. Right? Nothing could be like those nights. It was so beautiful. It was so beautiful. They will not cancel that particular slab that is so beautiful, so incredible. They were talking about, “Let’s take it down.” No, they’re not going to do it. They’re talking about Thomas Jefferson. They want to take it down. We stopped that. We stopped that. But these people, they’re sickos. It’s no question about it. There’s a lot of sickness there. So Kristi, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. And we’ll get the fireworks back. We’ll get those fireworks back. Okay?
Donald Trump: (39:33)
Great Mount Rushmore. County commissioners Michelle Hong and David Moore and my friend JJ and Jan Cafero. Great people. They’re great. Thank you. Thank you everybody, and thank you JJ, for being here. Thank you. Over the years, our movement achieved more than anyone thought possible. There’s never been anything like it. We passed record setting tax cuts, massive regulation cuts, which I think were even more important than tax cuts in terms of the economy. That’s what gave us that incredible base that they’re destroying slowly, but it was so strong. It has some momentum. Regulation cuts. Again, nobody’s ever seen anything and achieved American energy independence, which by next month will be gone. We’ll be buying our oil from the Middle East again, and we’ll be buying it from Russia. Remember Russia, Russia, Russia? We ended decades of disastrous trade deals. Withdrawing from the terrible Transpacific partnership, would have destroyed your businesses in Ohio and elsewhere. Replacing the NAFTA catastrophe with the brand new and unbelievably successful. You know why I knew it was good? Because Canada didn’t want it. Canada didn’t want it. Mexico didn’t want it either. President of Mexico, by the way. Great person. Great man, great guy. He’s doing a good job.
Donald Trump: (41:01)
But we did the USMCA, defending Ohio steel workers and standing up to China like never before. You wouldn’t have a steel industry if I didn’t do what we did. You would not have. They were dumping steel all over the place. Including making them pay tens of billions of dollars for the privilege of doing business in the USA. They never gave us 25 cents. And now they’re paying tens of billions, but Biden wants to end that. You want to see China take off? Take off those tariffs. Take off the taxes that we charged them.
Donald Trump: (41:37)
When the virus arrived, we produced three vaccines in record time, they said it would take three years to five years. We got it done in less than nine months. Record, record, record time. And we launched the fastest economic recovery anyone has ever seen. We really built the economy twice if you think about it. We built it twice. We set Joe Biden up so beautifully. All he had to do is go to the beach, Joe, go to the beach. Would have been so good. Instead, Biden is going to drive our economy and our country into ruin. Biden canceled the American Keystone XL pipeline and its 48,000 jobs for American workers. But he approved the Russian pipeline to Europe. That’s great. Remember they said, “Oh Trump, isn’t tough on Russia.” Really? I stopped the pipeline to Europe. I sanctioned them all over the place, and I had a good relationship with Putin, but that’s a good thing. That’s not a bad thing. That’s a good thing. That’s not bad. View that as good.
Donald Trump: (42:46)
And frankly had a great relationship also with President Xi of China, until we got hit with the virus. And then I couldn’t look at him quite the same way. Right? You can understand that. And we made a great trade deal that’s helping the manufacturers and the farmers like never before. Farmers have never done better because China is living up to that trade deal because they really sort of have to. It’s a tough deal, and we got it done, and a lot of people are benefiting. If you look at North Korea, right? Kim Jong-un, all of a sudden, he’s talking not nice. And he was talking very nice. I got along with him. I get along with everybody eventually. Eventually. Sometimes it just takes a little bit longer. But getting along with these people, that’s a good thing. Remember President Obama said, “We’re going to war with North Korea.” He said, “It’s virtually inevitable.” We didn’t go to war with North Korea. We didn’t go to war.
Donald Trump: (43:42)
And we don’t want to go to war with North Korea. 9,000 miles away. We didn’t want to go, but we did a good job, and the relationship that I have with him even to this day is a very good relationship, and that is a good thing. And there’s some I don’t like too. Some of them that take advantage of us that you wouldn’t even think. Canada was very tough on the United States in trade for a long time, until we came along. Other countries in Europe, you take a look at what they do. We protect them militarily. But they’re very, very tough on us in trade. “How many Chevrolets are sold in Berlin?” I asked, and they said, “Oh, we don’t believe any.” I said, “That’s exactly right.” No, no countries that you wouldn’t think, they take advantage of us like you wouldn’t believe.
Donald Trump: (44:25)
But Biden, reentered the job killing Paris climate accord, which will devastate Ohio oil and gas. Devastate and close large numbers of countries. It’s trillions of dollars of damage is going to be done. I ended it, and I couldn’t believe it. I said, “This is going to be a tough day.” BEcause it’s such a nice name. The Paris environmental accord. How nice is that, right? And I ended it. I said, “I’m going to get killed.” Everybody loved it when I ENDED it, everybody loved it. But we have to pay trillions. He put us immediately back without even negotiating. Just the same horrible deal. China doesn’t kick in for many years. Russia doesn’t kick in. India doesn’t kick in. But we kick in.
Donald Trump: (45:10)
He’s pushing trillions of dollars in new spending and the largest tax hike in history. He’s putting onto the American people and American industry. It’s going to be devastated. He puts America last. We put America first. It’s very simple. Very, very simple. And we rebuilt our military, and we did so much. Even right to try. I always mention, many people are being saved with right to try. The FDA is slow as hell. I wouldn’t say they love me too much. I pushed them very hard. But now if people are dying, they’re terminally ill. Instead of going to Asia, to Europe, to other countries to try and live, which was not very successful because we have the greatest doctors, scientists, and labs in the world. Now if somebody is terminally ill, and we have a cure that we think could be worked out good, but it’s going to take four years, five years, they sign a document, and they go and they take this new medication, whatever it may be. And it’s been unbelievably successful. They’ve been trying to get it approved for 45 years.
Donald Trump: (46:20)
We got it approved. But many, many things. What we’ve done for the vets, we had a 92% approval rating with the vets. 92%. nobody’s ever had a rating like that. We turned it all around. Under our administration, America was respected again. We were respected by other countries. You don’t have these things that we already talked about. You wouldn’t have had them go on if the election were not rigged. You wouldn’t have that happening. They wouldn’t be shooting thousands of missiles into Israel and all of the other things that we talk about, and many of that, we’re not going to talk about because we don’t have three nights. We have one beautiful night. It’s windy as hell up here, I will tell you that, but it’s beautiful. I brought this hat along just in case. Here. Just in case. But it is windy as hell up here.
Donald Trump: (47:19)
We stood up to the enemies of America. We withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, which was tremendous. Remember all the money, $150 billion dollars, and 1.8 billion in cash. 1.8 billion. Think of that crazy deal. And now he wants to make it again. We would have had a deal done with Iran in one week, had the election not been rigged and stolen. One week. It would have been done. And other things would have been done too. We were set up so beautifully and now all of it’s going down the tubes because they don’t know what the hell they’re doing.
Donald Trump: (47:58)
We wiped out ISIS. You remember that? ISIS, you remember? ISIS was taken out all over the middle East. With the real generals, the real generals, we wiped out ISIS. We knocked them out. We killed al-Baghdadi the founder of ISIS who was trying to build it again. And Qasem Soleimani, gone. He is the father of the roadside bomb that killed so many of our soldiers. He’s gone. He’s gone. He was killed.
Donald Trump: (48:28)
We fully rebuilt the United States military. Created space force. Everybody laughed. Everybody laughed. Remember when the press secretary with the extremely red hair, remember what she said? She laughed at when space force was benching. She laughed. Remember that? And she got decimated by everybody when she laughed, because we need space force. Russia’s up there, big league. And China’s up there, big league. And we were just sitting around watching them. And now we have overtaken them in space. It’s great. It’s great. Already. During my term, but they’ll blow that.
Donald Trump: (49:10)
And we got our allies to pay their fair share when it came to our defending them and NATO, I got $430 billion from them. They weren’t paying. I said to other countries, nice countries, but why should they pay if we’re not asking? I said, “You’re delinquent.” Like a real estate deal. ” You’re delinquent.” They said, “Would you leave if we don’t pay?” I said, “Yes,” because I have to say that. If I said no, they’re not going to pay, right? We got $430 billion. We were paying, in my opinion, close to a hundred percent of the defense of European nations who, excuse the language, screw us on trade. So they take advantage of us on trade, and we defend them for nothing. And in the case, Germany, Germany pays Russia billions and billions of dollars for-
Donald Trump: (50:03)
… Russia, billions and billions of dollars for the Pipeline. And yet, we defend them against Russia. I said to Angela, who I like a lot, actually. I get along with her, actually, good. I got along with her very good. But she’s tough and she’s smart. And she takes advantage of the United States. I said, “So Angela, we defend you from a country that you’re giving billions and billions of dollars to a month. How does that work Angela?” And she just smiled. She just smiled. She knows.
Donald Trump: (50:31)
We recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And at the same time recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We were working on that for 54 years. And we made historic peace deals in the Middle East that nobody thought were even possible. And frankly, if we were there, I think we’d have it totally wrapped up, but I don’t see any signs of progress with these people. In fact, they want to go back to negotiating with Iran. It’s just not even believable.
Donald Trump: (51:06)
But now Joe Biden is squandering all of this hard-earned respect that we have, or had. Bowing down to America’s enemies and embarrassing our country on the world stage. You saw that, it was an embarrassment. And yet the fake news said, “He reminded me of FDR.” I’ll never forget it. I watched. I watched the semi-State of the Union, it was sort of a weird State of the Union.
Donald Trump: (51:39)
Nancy Pelosi had the single largest mask I’ve ever seen on a human being. It’s true. It’s the biggest. She had a mask that went up to here. I don’t know if it was three masks or one, but it was the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. But I’ll never forget. I watched. And I said, “that’s said.” I said, “He’s going to be killed by the media.” Then I turned on to fake news: CNN and MSDNC and they said… Fox hasn’t been so great either. Have they?
Audience: (52:11)
No! Boo!
Donald Trump: (52:16)
And they said… I thought he was just going to get… It was a terrible evening. And honestly, if I do a bad speech, I’ll tell you it was a bad… that’s okay. But I don’t do bad speeches. Do I? Do I? I don’t think so. No. Actually my best speeches, I get the best reviews when I don’t use these suckers. They’re too easy. Especially when they’re blowing in the wind, great job fellas, by the way, you really made them nice. I got this teleprompter that is waving like the American flag, proudly. Great job. Great. Sometimes you have no choice to just wing it. You have to wing it because you have a teleprompter that’s moving so rapidly. But, I watched his speech that he made and I said, “Man, he’s going to get just decimated. This thing is a disaster.” I turned onto a couple of the competing networks, call them. And they’re saying, “Not since FDR, has there been a speech like this.” FDR, I thought he had a magnificent presence, right? He would sit up there and his voice was beautiful and booming and elegant. And you remember so many of his phrases, right? “The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.” It was so beautiful. Think of that, the way it was said, you always remember it. You can’t forget it. “The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.” Okay. And they were comparing Biden to FDR. They are fake. They are so fake and so pathetic. And there’s so many of them up there. There’s so many of them.
Audience: (53:54)
Boo! Boo!
Donald Trump: (54:02)
And they’re hurting our country very badly. Honestly, they’re hurting our country because they’re not real. They’re not real.
Audience: (54:08)
CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!
Donald Trump: (54:21)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Are we having a good time, by the way?
Audience: (54:25)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (54:28)
You know, the subject matter is somewhat depressing, in all fairness. Because what happened to us on November the third, should never, ever happen again. Should never be allowed to happen again. Biden and the Democrats are weak on China, weak on Iran, weak on trade, weak on the economy and weak on everything else, except for weaponizing law enforcement to go after Republicans. Right? That’s the only thing they’re strong on.
Donald Trump: (54:54)
Shortly after taking office, Joe Biden even canceled the US government investigation into the origins of the virus in a China lab. Do you remember when I said it comes out of Wuhan, it comes out of the lab? They went crazy. Now they’re saying, “Most likely it came out of the Wuhan lab.”
Donald Trump: (55:16)
Unlike Biden, I believe that China owes the world and the United States trillions and trillions of dollars and they have to pay. They have to pay. And as you can see, and you’ve seen over the last three weeks, the media and the Democrats are now admitting that I was right about everything. The election is over, now we won the election anyway, but the election’s over, so they don’t care. They don’t care. Now they’re saying, “Well, he was right about these things.” That’s all right. Big deal. Right? Big deal.
Donald Trump: (55:53)
They lied about so many things before the election. And it’s not only what they said, it’s also what they didn’t say. Like Hunter, remember? Where’s Hunter? The virus came from a Chinese lab. Hydroxychloroquine actually works. Remember? Remember?
Donald Trump: (56:16)
I made a mistake on hydroxy. I should have said, “Hydroxychloroquine is a disaster. Please do not use it.” They would have said… Instead I said, “It works,” and now reports are coming out that it works. They probably destroyed a lot of lives. Hunter Biden’s laptop was real. That was an easy one. Wasn’t it? Lafayette Square was not cleared for a photo op. It wasn’t. They tried to burn down the church the day before, we got lucky to stop them. They tried. The basement was on fire.
Donald Trump: (56:49)
The Russian bounty story was a total fake by these guys. Look, the cameras are starting to go off. Oh, the cameras are going off. I better speak fast. Those cameras are going off. They don’t like this. They don’t like this speech. You have the nice red light at the beginning of the camera, that thing was lit up. All of a sudden those suckers are off so fast. Don’t worry. They’ll go back. You know why they go back? Because they get great ratings when we do these things. They’ll go back. They’ll wait until this section is over. They don’t want to talk about certain things. You know what they especially don’t want to talk about? The election of 2020, because it’s just too easy, too close to home.
Donald Trump: (57:31)
The first vaccine was known to be effective before the election.
Audience: (57:36)
Trump won! Trump won! Trump won!
Donald Trump: (58:02)
Remember when they wouldn’t report that the vaccine was effective before the election? Right after the election, oh, the big vaccine story, it was the greatest thing ever. But before, they wouldn’t report it, they wouldn’t report it. Blue state lockdowns don’t work, they didn’t want to talk about it. And our children should be back in school. They don’t want to talk about that either.
Donald Trump: (58:23)
We were also right about Joe Biden and the Democrats extremism on open borders, on socialism, on taxes, on energy, on the Green New Deal hoax. That’s the next hoax. You have the crime of the century, which I consider to be the election of 2020. I consider that, because you look at all the people that are dying on the border, you look at all of the bad things that are happening to our country, I consider it to be the crime of the century.
Donald Trump: (58:52)
But the Green New Deal is a crime because it’s a total con job. Everybody knew this during the campaign, but the fake news media refused to talk about it because they will say and do anything to destroy our great MAGA movement, which is a movement based on strength and peace and law and order. And above all else, it’s a movement based on common sense. It’s common sense. There’s never been a movement like it. There has never been.
Donald Trump: (59:28)
Over the years, I’ve seen people, if they did fairly well in a primary 30 years ago, they become stars, fairly well. We won the election twice. And it’s possible we’ll have to win it a third time. It’s possible.
Audience: (59:42)
USA! USA! USA!
Donald Trump: (01:00:06)
A certain reporter said to me, not on our side, this is a very liberal person, but sort of an honest person said to me, “You know, I’ve been covering elections for a long time. Long, long time. I’ve never seen anything like the election of 2020. You had 58 rallies. The average crowd had to be 25, 30…” Look at tonight. Look at this. This is not even election territory, other than you got to get Mike and Max in there. And Max is going to be in a little while longer. Mike, don’t forget August 3rd. But think of it. Think of it. He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it where you’d have a rally some days on one day notice and you’d have 30, 40, 50,000.” Butler, Pennsylvania, 58,000 people in a couple of days, right?
Donald Trump: (01:00:54)
And were up by so much. And then the next day they say, “Trump lost Pennsylvania.” Not possible, not possible. We had 58,000 people in a beautiful, small community in Pennsylvania show up on a couple of days notice, right? Showed up.
Donald Trump: (01:01:11)
And then they say like, “Biden’s coming to town,” and they have eight circles, right? And they can’t fill them. So they go back and they get the fake news. “Could you please stand in a circle?” And they get reporters to stand in them. And then they say, “Trump lost Pennsylvania.” No, I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I think all you have to do is look at every stat. And it’s all coming out now, you know? And people are coming forward. People are coming forward like never before. You’re seeing what’s happening or you soon will see what’s happening. But think of it, 75 million voters, the same reporter said, “It was incredible. Whether you’re on your side or the other side, we’ve never seen anything like it. Never seen anything like it.”
Donald Trump: (01:01:58)
He said, “What was the difference between 2016 when you won? And 2020 when you lost?” I said, “The difference was we did much better the second time.” It’s true. I was told that we got 63 million votes, right? I was told that if we get 65, by the best pollster, one of the great pollsters, you have a few of them that are really good. But John McLaughlin. He said, “Sir, if you get 65 million, if you go up two…” Now, most presidents go down. Obama went down, he went down much lower the second time, he got fewer votes the second time, far fewer. And I understand that, that’s the way it works. But we went up 12 million. But I was told if we go up two million, we win. We went up 12 million and we so-called lost, but we didn’t lose, we didn’t lose. We didn’t lose.
Donald Trump: (01:02:49)
But I said, the big difference is that we did much better the second time. And think of it. 63 million compared to almost 75 million. And don’t forget that 75 million, what’s the real number? With all of the shenanigans. What’s the real number? The socialist Democrats see this better than anyone else. They know exactly what went on and they don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it.
Donald Trump: (01:03:18)
You know what’s interesting? Hillary Clinton can complain about the election, by the way, she is the single most unhappy person in the United States because she said, “Why didn’t you do that for me? Why didn’t you create votes for me?” Because she said, “I was much closer.”
Audience: (01:03:37)
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
Donald Trump: (01:03:47)
Bad things. Bad, bad things. Why didn’t you create a… for Hillary Clinton? I do ask that question. Actually, the truth is we got them by surprise in 2016 and in 2020, they planned for four years. They said, “This is not going to happen again.” They planned it out. Earlier this year, the Biden administration issued new rules, pushing twisted, critical race theory into classrooms across the nation and also into our military. Our generals and our admirals are now focused more on this nonsense than they are on our enemies. You see these generals lately on television? They are woke. They’re woke.
Donald Trump: (01:04:32)
Our military will be incapable of fighting and incapable of taking orders. You’re going to tell some private, “Private, stand up. You stand up right now.” “I’m not standing up. You can’t talk to me that way, General.” We’re going to have a whole different ball game here. I don’t know how they’re going to work that out. The private’s going to tell the general, “Don’t you ever speak to me that way, General, I’ll kick your ass.” That’s our military. That’s where we’re going. Woke. I know some of these guys, boy, they change quickly. They went right over to the other side. I heard that about a couple of them. The military brass have become weak and ineffective leaders and our enemies are watching and they’re laughing.
Donald Trump: (01:05:18)
We need a Republican Congress to ban critical race theory. I had it banned through executive order and it was fine. And then when we didn’t get in, they immediately re-instituted it, but where’s it all gone? But they have to get it out of our schools and they have to ban it in our workplaces and ban it in our states and ban it in federal agencies and ban it in our military, maybe most importantly.
Donald Trump: (01:05:46)
In addition, if government run schools are going to teach children to hate our country and racism, racism, racism, parents must be given the power to opt out of the horrible, horrible schools. They’re being forced to send their kids to these schools and we have to provide school choice. And we were a long way to getting it.
Donald Trump: (01:06:09)
The radical left is trying to rip our nation apart and there is no depth to which they will not sink. You’ve seen it. You’ve seen it and you’ve seen it strongly. Just can’t have it. There’s no better example that the election that we talk about and talk about, so proudly, because we did so well, the 2020 presidential election, was rigged. We won the election in a landslide. You know it, I know it. And you know who else knows it? The fake news knows it.
Donald Trump: (01:06:43)
Democrats and their allies in big tech and in the fake news media viciously did everything possible to deny our victory and to delay the count until they could figure out how many votes were needed to drag Joe Biden across the finish line. You know that. Now they sensor, conceal and smear you. If you look into the election today, and I saw the other day where they were saying, “We are going to look into the election.” I said, “That’s great.” No, they’re not looking into that. They’re looking into the people that want the truth. They’re not looking into the election. The election was the lie. That was the big lie. They talk about the big lie. They always say, “While it is totally disproven…” Every sentence. Like every sentence they say… Well, I would say no, it’s totally disproven in the opposite way. But the big lie is what took place on the evening. And the morning, November 3rd, November 4th, November 5th. And they know it and they don’t want to talk about it.
Donald Trump: (01:07:48)
Have you ever noticed, though, I was going to say, so Hillary Clinton’s allowed to talk about it, right? Stacey Abrams. She said she won for governor. By the way, we might’ve been better if she did win for governor of Georgia, if you want to know the truth, we might’ve had a better governor if she did win. But Stacey Abrams goes around saying she won the election. Nobody says anything. Hillary Clinton says she won the election. Nobody says anything. I say we won the election. “That’s terrible. That’s terrible.”
Donald Trump: (01:08:20)
Isn’t it a terrible situation? All these geniuses are running for office and they’re doing good. And we’re going to introduce them in a couple of seconds and we’re having a good time and we’ll just keep it going. Should we keep it going or get there hell out of here?
Audience: (01:08:33)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (01:08:35)
For the first time in history, they mass mail tens of millions of absentee ballots and ballot applications to every person on the rolls, dead or alive, legal or illegal, resident or non-resident, of our country. They installed millions of dollars worth of illegal, unmanned dropboxes. How about these dropboxes where they were 96% for Joe Biden? The vote was 96 for Biden and some of them showed up very, very late. They say, “Where are they?” Oh, they come the next day. 96% for Biden.
Donald Trump: (01:09:09)
And you know, I was told that you can give $5,600, but Zuckerberg gave $500 million to all of this stuff. Now that’s legal, right? That’s legal? I don’t think so. And the whole lockbox scam. That’s another thing. That’s just one of many things they did. In fact, what happened here is what the State Department used to criticize in communist countries, illegal use of absentee ballots. They went after them very strongly.
Donald Trump: (01:09:37)
Opposition observers ejected. They would take the opposition observers like they did in Detroit and they did in Atlanta and they did in Philadelphia where you had more votes than you had voters. Other than that, it was a very good election. But you had more votes than you had voters. Other than that, it was wonderful.
Donald Trump: (01:09:59)
But they did a North Korean style turnout. This is what they talked about. Illegally altered vote tabulation data. All of these things, this is what they used to talk about. These things happen, they said, in Ukraine in 2004. Now to a large extent, they happened here. We’ll prove it. We’ll be out there fighting.
Donald Trump: (01:10:22)
You have incredible American patriots. You have incredible American patriots. I saw one here, I didn’t even know he was coming. Where is Mike? The pillow man? Where is it? I saw him. Mike Lindell.
Audience: (01:10:47)
Mike! Mike! Mike!
Donald Trump: (01:11:06)
It’s amazing. He’s out there fighting. He is a patriot and he’s got people fighting with them. They are really patriots. And I think on behalf of… Look at the crowd, they’re going up. I’m not sure that even Jim got as big a hand as you, okay? But they’re going up. Look at this crowd, going as far as the eye can see, and they’re all giving you a standing ovation. So we appreciate it, Mike. We appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (01:11:32)
But as many, many people will tell you, including the gentleman that spoke before you this evening, I understand, there’s just mountains of evidence, including on camera, in the middle of the night, when ballots were pulled from under the tables. You saw that? After Republican poll watches were kicked the hell out of the counting rooms, you saw that? With the woman with the tables? They said, “There’s a massive water main leak. Everybody leave.” They all ran out for their lives. They ran out so fast. And then this group of people came in and they started stuffing the ballot boxes. That’s all it was. It’s a terrible thing. That was in Georgia, where they said everything was so wonderful.
Donald Trump: (01:12:17)
And by the way, now they’re saying they’re going to delete over a hundred thousand names. I said, “Why the hell didn’t you delete them before the election? Not after the election?” Why didn’t they do that? Why didn’t they do it before the election? Ballots were wheeled in through back doors in swing states days after the election. They had no idea that we were going to win by this much. They thought it was going to be a close election and then all of a sudden they see these massive numbers in Pennsylvania.
Donald Trump: (01:12:48)
I hear now that Wisconsin is looking very, very seriously, and I respect Wisconsin so much. It’s a great state. They’re looking very seriously. Pennsylvania is really starting to take this very seriously. And Michigan is not. You can’t get those Republicans, some are great, by the way, but Michigan is not doing the job. They’re right by you. How do you win Ohio by so much, record numbers, and lose Michigan? There’s one way I can tell you. There’s one way. But the rhinos in Michigan Senate are not doing anything. So I think the people are really starting to push them very strongly. But I want to thank Pennsylvania. I want to thank Wisconsin. They’re really starting to move and they don’t like what they’re seeing.
Donald Trump: (01:13:40)
In Montana, over six percent of a certain county’s mail-in ballots are missing, evidence to prove if they were legitimate or not, they’re missing all of this evidence and think of it, Montana. A lot of mail-in ballots. Wherever you have the mail-in ballots, by the way, did you see the fraudulent votes in New York City for the congressional race? I actually think that the woman Democrat lost, okay, but they were weeks and weeks, they couldn’t figure it out. They were all gone. I could figure it out. But those mail-in ballots are treacherous, the way they can manipulate them, get rid of them, lose them.
Donald Trump: (01:14:20)
The affidavits from hundreds and hundreds of poll workers and poll watchers and witnesses across the country were signed under penalty of perjury, but they were silenced and never ever heard in court because many of our judges were gutless. And our Supreme Court, I must say, I am ashamed of our Supreme Court. I’m ashamed. They were not allowed to be seen or be used.
Donald Trump: (01:14:49)
And I won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, when that happens, you win. When that happens, you win. If you win Ohio, and if you win Florida, you win. If you win Ohio and you win Florida…
Donald Trump: (01:15:02)
… win. If you win Ohio and you win Florida and you win Iowa and all by big numbers, big, big win in Florida, all by big numbers. When that happens, nobody’s ever lost. Nobody’s ever lost. This was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century.
Donald Trump: (01:15:21)
We swung to the previously democrat Starr County on the border of Texas. Gained a half million votes in Los Angeles County and doubled my vote total in a place called the Bronx because we did great with Hispanics. And we did great with the African American community, but it didn’t matter that much. Vote counting is an amazing thing. And yet we’re told Joe Biden, who couldn’t fill 12 circles in a high school gym got 81 million votes.
Donald Trump: (01:15:54)
You know, the 75 is the largest vote in the history of our country for a sitting president, right? No president has ever gotten anywhere even close to that number. One poll manager, who worked in Fulton County, Georgia for two decades, said that she witnessed thousands and thousands of counterfeit ballots for Joe Biden with identical photocopied markings. They were all identical. They were all done identically. How does that happen? She was pressured to drop her claim and then she was fired very, very viciously.
Donald Trump: (01:16:27)
Instead of hearing evidence from election fraud experts RINOs in Michigan are calling for sham investigations to shut down. “Shut it down immediately,” say these RINO Republicans. Shut it down immediately. Even though Detroit is perhaps the single most corrupt election area in the United States. You heard what happened there. The number of votes and the number of voters and these guys say, “Shut it down.” Somebody’s going to have to say, “Why do they want to shut down?” 55% of voters support election audits.
Donald Trump: (01:17:03)
And again I want to thank the brave Republican senators in the State of Arizona for what they’re doing. Because they saw what was happening, and I have nothing to do. What’s going to happen is they are going to issue a report at sometime in the not too distant future and it will be very interesting to see. But that’s them doing it, this is the State Senate of Arizona. Let’s see how that comes out, but I guess it’s going to be coming out very, very soon. And a lot of states have gone to watch them and they’ve come away with praise, real praise. So let’s see how that turns out. Arizona, it’s a big deal.
Donald Trump: (01:17:44)
And a lot of things are happening now in the State of Georgia with all of the cancellation and all of the things that they’re doing and all of the votes that they’re taking out of the system and all of the dead people that they’re finding. These are dead. Some of the dead people requested an application and then voted. Even 30% of Democrats think there was cheating in the election and 78% of the Republicans think there was major, major cheating. Think of that.
Donald Trump: (01:18:16)
How do you have a government? You got to solve this problem because you can’t have a country … you know, I say, you need borders. Can’t have a country without borders. Well, you can’t have a country that’s not going to have elections that are real and free. And people have to know that they’re real and free. Otherwise you don’t have a country. You don’t have a country. Our government spent four years and $48 million on a fabricated witch hunt about Russia, Russia, Russia.
Donald Trump: (01:18:46)
Hillary Clinton’s the one that paid for it. You believe it? She paid for it. Her and the DNC. Think of the DNC. They paid for it. And after years they learned, how about this, four years, went on from the day I came down to the escalator with our great former first lady, from the day I came down. And at the end, they said, “No collusion.” Friend of mine called up and said, “You have to be the most honest person in history.” They spent $48 million. They had 18 angry democrats, really angry democrats. And they got nothing. Pretty amazing, right?
Donald Trump: (01:19:26)
I have friends that say they couldn’t have done that. But now if you question an election and you fight for the Constitution, like the greatest mayor in the history of the city of New York, Rudy Giuliani, they cancel your law license. Radical left-wing democrats, they cancel your law license and the FBI agents go and raid your home like they did to Rudy Giuliani. Think of it, he was the greatest mayor in the history of the city. He took a city that was almost as bad as it is now with crime and he solved the problem and he made it a hot, great place. And this is the way they treat him. It’s a very, very sad and very, very dangerous time for our country.
Donald Trump: (01:20:16)
This corrupt establishment is censoring, blacklisting, and persecuting people who call them out on their flagrant lies and deceit like the results of the election, people are getting called out for. But they don’t, again, they don’t question people with Hillary and they don’t question many other people that, falsely claim, because I say that’s real falsely claim. She couldn’t even get back in. And we have big back in. We have a big, big group of people and good people, patriotic people.
Donald Trump: (01:20:48)
The biggest tragedy of all is millions of Americans have lost confidence in their vote. We can’t let that happen. And that’s why I say you have to know what took place in 2020, before you can vote in 2022 or 2024. You have to know. You know, I have a lot of friends, I have a lot of friends, great people and patriots, and they love me and everything is good. They say, “President, don’t look back, look forward. You’re leading in every poll. You’re going to win the election so big in ’24. Don’t look back.” And you know what I say? You have to look back. You have to look back. We won the election in 2020. Who the hell knows what’s going to be in 2024. We won’t even have a country left. We’re not going to have a country left. And if we don’t figure it out, we’re not going to be in a position to win in 2022 or 2024. We’ll never stop fighting for the true results of this election. And it’s moving along rapidly, whether it’s Democrats or RINOs who stand in our way.
Donald Trump: (01:22:00)
And you know, in many cases, the RINOs are worse than the democrats. They think they can run our country like a dictatorship, but the American people are very smart, courageous, and unafraid. And we Will not let that happen. We can’t. We can’t. Remember, I’m not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I’m the one that’s trying to save American democracy. It’s true. Republicans across the country are uniting around a plan to fully secure every future election with a voter ID. Now, all of a sudden the democrats, they fought it for years. Now it’s a 90% issue in the polls and the democrats, “Well, we always liked voter ID.” Do you believe this one? They always liked voter ID for the first time. Universal signature verification, citizenship confirmation, chain of custody, integrity controls, updated voter rolls. Which are just terrible. It’s just terrible. The voter rolls. Illegal aliens allowed to vote. Strong protection of poll watchers. In Philadelphia, in Detroit, they literally harassed innocent republican poll watches the hell out of a building. For days and days and days as this election went on. It was a terrible thing they did. Illegal dropboxes and restoring the time honored tradition of in-person voting on election day. What’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with that? They used COVID in order to cheat. They used COVID in order to rig the election and in order to steal the election. They used COVID, that’s as simple as it gets. With the help of everyone here tonight and patriots all across the country, we will do all that we are supposed to be doing and much more when we win giant Republican majorities next year.
Donald Trump: (01:24:15)
Also with us tonight, by the way, are some of the great people running for the senate. Mike Gibbons. Mike, thank you very much, Mike. Jane Timken, great job at the Republican Party. Jane, where’s Jane? Jane, thank you, Jane. Great job. Bernie Mareno. Bernie, thank you very much. Thank you, Bernie. And Mrs. Mareno, Thank you very much. And Josh Mendel. Thank you, Josh.
Donald Trump: (01:24:48)
Hey, do you want to take a poll? Ready? Who likes Jane Timken? Who likes Josh Mandel? What about Gibbons? Who likes Gibbons? I think we’ll get out of this poll stuff. We’ll get out. We’ll get out. But they’re great people. They’re working hard. I do love those polls though. Those polls usually turn out to be very accurate. And you know, you have a guy running, Tim Ryan. He’s a disaster. He’s a stiff. He’s a total stiff. Between him and his counterpart with the lover from China, got a Chinese lover who happens to be a spy, right? Eric Swalwell. How about Swalwell?
Donald Trump: (01:25:48)
Is he the worst? Between him … think of it. Shifty Schiff, they walk out. “We will take strong action against President Trump for his relationships with Russia.” I’m saying, “What the hell do I have to do with Russia?” I’m trying to figure it out. These people are really dishonest people. Tim Ryan is a disaster. He’s a guy who failed Ohio and his district. He couldn’t even get the vote that he needed in his own district in the last election. He’s laughed at all over Washington. He’s disrespected in Washington. He talks about workers. All the time he’s talking about workers, but he does nothing for the worker. It was all of the things that I did. My trade deals, my tariffs, my energy policies, my reduced taxes and regulations, and everything else. That’s what happened to our workers in this country and that’s why we came up with numbers the likes of which … we had 160 million people working, there’s never been anything like it.
Donald Trump: (01:26:48)
In 2020, I became the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win a place called Lorain County. Has anyone ever heard of it? Has anyone ever heard of it? Next year, the Republican red wave is going to begin right here with a republican congress. We will fight for more jobs for Ohio families, fair trade for Ohio workers, and more Ohio factories forging more products stamped with that beautiful, beautiful phrase “Made in the USA”. Made in the USA. We will stand up to China, make them pay trillions in reparations and ensure that America, not China, dominates the future. We will defend American sovereignty. We will secure America’s borders and we will end illegal immigration, that dangerous, horrible term once and for all. We will break up big tech monopolies, reject left wing cancel culture, and we will restore the right to free speech in America.
Donald Trump: (01:28:08)
We will protect innocent life. We will defend our constitution and we will proudly upheld Judeo Christian values and principles of our nation’s founding. We will care for our veterans, continue to strengthen our military, and give our police offices, border patrol, ICE, and law enforcement of all kinds 100% support. There will be no defunding. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. No matter how powerful the sinister forces we are up against may seem, and they do look powerful and they get more powerful as we get weak. And we got weak over the last five months. Very, very pathetic and very, very, weak. We must never forget this country does not belong to them. It belongs to you, the American people. This is your home. This nation is your heritage. And our magnificent American liberty is your God given right. The people of this land will not be ruled and talked down to by corrupt politicians, petty tyrants, left-wing bullies, or socialist bureaucrats in a place called Washington DC. It’s not going to happen. Our ancestors are the people that crossed an ocean for the right to live and pray and speak as they saw fit. They are the people who risked everything. They risked everything. Think of what, you’re here and you’re generally happy, not necessarily 100% because of what took place, but they are the people who risked their lives to boldly declare their independence and then defeated the most powerful military on earth to win their freedom. Brave, incredible, brilliant people. And our ancestors are the people who tamed the great wilderness, settled a vast continent, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world and were not going to let it go. We will respect our heroes like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson. They will not be taken from us. America is still the nation that conquered the Wild West, that vanquished the murderers, dictators that ended the evil empires. And that sent a brave young man from Ohio to a plant. Think of it. [Seth 01:31:39], you know who the man I’m talking about is? Who am I talking about? Do you know who it is? The stars and stripes on the face of the moon. Do you know who the man is, right? Do you know? Do you know? You know who it is. There is no mountain we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. There is nothing that we cannot do. There is absolutely nothing we cannot match. There is no challenge that you will let us down. You will never let us down. The people of Ohio will never let us down. The people of our country will never let us down.
Donald Trump: (01:32:19)
We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never, ever surrender. My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
Donald Trump: (01:32:55)
So with American pride swelling in our hearts and American courage stirring in our souls, I say these words to you tonight, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you very much.

			Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much to Lee. Thank you, Lee. Well, he’s been so great. Michael, thank you very much and congratulations on your reelection today as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. We love this state. You’ve done a great job, Michael, and we thank you very much. We really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. I love you too.
Donald Trump: (02:31)
It’s great to be back in Greenville with so many proud North Carolina Patriots who love our country, support our military, respect our police, honor our flag and always put America first. We don’t put America second. As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding. Police departments are being ripped apart and defunded. Can you believe that? Is that good politics, defund our police? Number one, it’s bad for our country, but think of it, defund our police. You know, I’ve long said they’re vicious, they’re violent. They in many cases, hate our country and they have bad policy. Now, the bad news from our standpoint, they stick together. They don’t have some of the people like we have where they go on their own and they do what they have to. They stick together, and that’s the one thing they have. They stick together, but their policy is so bad.
Donald Trump: (03:34)
We’re going to have a tremendous 2022, just like we did frankly, 2020. Think of it. More votes than any sitting president in the history of the United States by far. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election. You look at our border, is wide open. Illegal immigration is skyrocketing at a level that we’ve never seen before, and this is over a period of a few months. Drugs are pouring in. Gas prices are soaring. Our industries are being pillaged by foreign cyber attacks. That’s a lack of respect for our country and for our leaders. Speaking of our leaders, they’re bowing down to China. America is being demeaned and humiliated on the world stage. Our freedom is being overtaken by left wing cancel culture, and the Biden administration is pushing toxic critical race theory and illegal discrimination into our children’s schools.
Donald Trump: (04:39)
Now you tell me, we take this? Joe Biden and the Socialist Democrats are the most radical left-wing administration in history. Even Bernie Sanders can’t believe it. He said, I can’t believe this happened. This is worse than I ever was. I don’t know if they even know what the hell they’re signing. Somebody is drawing these documents and putting it, and it’s getting signed. It’s a disgrace what’s happening to our country. The survival of America depends upon our ability to elect Republicans at every level, starting with the midterms next year. We have to get it done. We have to get it done. We have no choice, actually. We have to get it done. Together, we’re going to defend our freedoms. You just take a look at what’s happening. We have to defend our borders. We have to do all of these things and the cancel culture, the defunding culture, the defending culture and they defend the wrong things, we’re not going to let it go any longer. Going to stand up for our values. We have to stand up for our values, and we’re going to take back our country and we’re going to take it back at a level that is very, very good for our country and it’s good for citizens because we can’t allow bad things to happen to our country. Bad, bad things are happening to us, perhaps like never before. You’ll be seeing what goes on and perhaps like never before.
Donald Trump: (06:12)
With us, this evening are many outstanding North Carolina Republican leaders who are fighting right by our side, including one of the strongest and bravest new voices in the Republican party, has been a great supporter of mine and I’m a great supporter of his, your incredible Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. Stand up, Mark. Good job. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. We’re also joined by some of your terrific representatives in Congress. I think Virginia Fox is here, who I just endorsed. Where’s Virginia? She’s around here someplace. Virginia, thank you very much. Thank you, Virginia. I thought, Virginia, you should have a better seat than that. I’m sorry. A great guy and a friend of mine, a tremendous supporter, David Rouser. David, thank you very much. Thank you, David. Dan Bishop, right from the beginning, been so good. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. Great job. We had a big victory that night. Didn’t we, Dan? Huh? They said, I don’t know if he’s going to win. He won. He won big.
Donald Trump: (07:35)
Richard Hudson. Richard, thank you. Great job, Richard. Great job. Somebody I’ve gotten to know very well, and he is a handsome sucker. Where’s Madison? Madison Cawthorn. Where is Madison? Where is our Madison? Thank you, Madison. Thank you. What a great guy. What a good future you’ve got. Where the hell is Madison? Thank you, Madison. Great job. Thank you very much. If I had a face like him, I would have been president 20 years earlier. 20 years earlier, Madison. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Greg Murphy. Where’s Greg? Thank you, Greg. You’re doing a really great job. We’re proud of you. A friend of mine and somebody that’s really been incredible, respected by everybody, congressman Ted Budd. Where’s Ted?Good job, Ted. Good job. Here as well are two people that you may know of, actually, I probably like her better because she was a supporter of mine before he was. People don’t know that. Deb Meadows, stand up. Stand up, Deb. We have to say Deb, he wasn’t far behind. It wasn’t like many, many months. No, he had somebody else in mind, but he switched over very quickly. I don’t know if he had a choice. Right, Deb? Mark Meadows, everybody, a real great guy.
Donald Trump: (09:24)
With the spirit and energy and commitment of everyone in this room and the voters all across this state, 2022 is going to be a banner year for North Carolina Republicans. You know, they said this state was… If you look back 10 years ago, Michael, they said this state was finished. It was not going to be a Republican state at all, and they had elected a Governor, and it really looked bad. Then these guys, some of them that I just announced but others also, we all got together, and you’ve never been in a stronger position, and now you’re going to have another Senator. We just elected a wonderful friend of ours, and Tom is going to be great. I think Tom, he got off to a little rocky start with protect Bob Mueller, but you know what, he flipped in the other direction totally, and he’s been terrific. He had a great race. He ran a great race. He really did, and he had my total support. He called me just a little while ago to tell me, enjoy the state because I love the state. I love being in this state. I just want to say that this was going to be a Democrat state, and here we are and we’re really dominating when you look at everything that’s happened, so congratulations. It’s really great. To you, congratulations.
Donald Trump: (10:38)
I think we’re going to gain two or even three US House seats. We’re going to take over, if you look over the House today and get rid of Nancy Pelosi. Remember, they stick together. On an impeachment hoax, not one Democrat, not one voted against. Well actually, we had one that came over to our side who is a terrific person, actually, but you take a look and they didn’t want to do that, but they just do it a little bit differently. They play very tough, very dirty, and we just can’t let it happen. We’re going to win north Carolina’s all important US Senate race, and we’re going to lay the groundwork for making sure that Republicans, once again, carry the great state of North Carolina, in a number, a year, that I look very much forward to, 2024.
Donald Trump: (11:34)
We’re going to do numbers like you’ve never seen before. So many things are happening right now, but they’re… We’re going to do things like you’ve never, ever seen before. I stand before you today, confident that the people of North Carolina will decisively reject Joe Biden and the radical Democrats, the war on the American worker, the American family and the American nation. I have to tell you that I have a very special person, she’s been… I love my family. I love my family. I happen to love this particular young man that she’s married to. He’s a very tall person by the way, but not as tall as Baron. Baron is six foot seven, can you believe it, and he’s 15. Eric is short. He’s only six foot six, but we love our Eric and we love them all. They’re all great. He is married to a very special woman, Lara, and I’d like to have her… You know, she was born in this particular state. She loves this particular state, and maybe I’d like to ask Laura Trump to come up and say a few words. Laura, please. Come on up.
Lara Trump: (13:15)
Okay, my people. Can we just start off really quickly, and I’ll keep this brief, but Donald Trump is two and O in the state of North Carolina folks. How about it? Not bad. I got to thank all of you because I promised my father-in-law that we would win this state for him, and we won it in two elections, so thanks to all of you. I really, you guys know, I was born and raised in this state. I absolutely love the state of North Carolina. My parents, Bob and Linda are here with my brother, Kyle. They drove in from Wilmington to be here tonight. My brother graduated from ECU right here in Greenville. He’s a pirate. This state truly made me the person that I am today. I love this state so much, I named my daughter Carolina. Okay? I don’t want any of you UNC fans to get any ideas because y’all know I’m Wolf Pack for life. All right? I just want to set that one straight.
Lara Trump: (14:23)
Now, you may have heard a rumor that I have been considering possibly running for a Senate seat here in North Carolina. I have been considering it, and it’s a big decision in case nobody knew. It’s a very big deal, and look, it’s something I did a lot of soul searching, a lot of thinking, talking with my father-in-law, my parents, my husband, Eric, and because of the values my parents instilled in me, they taught me that when you do something, you give 100%. That is the only way to operate. Because of my two kids who are very young, one and three, Carolina and Luke, it is going to be very hard for me to enter this Senate race right now, but I am saying no for now, not no forever, just so you know.
Lara Trump: (15:17)
I came here tonight with my father-in-law because there is a very special person who is going to do an amazing job as your next Senator from the state of North Carolina, that he is going to announce tonight here in this room. I can promise you this: just because my name is not on the ballot does not mean I am not fighting every step of the way with you here in North Carolina because if we’re being honest, this is so much bigger than a Senate seat. It’s about the future of America. We have to fight for our conservative values. We have to have a person in that Senate seat who represents North Carolina and is going to lead this country in the right direction.
Lara Trump: (16:00)
I want to say thank you to everybody. I have so much support and so many people that were so sweet and poured out so much love for me with the thought of me possibly running, so again, no for now, not no forever. At the right time, I would absolutely love to come back and consider running for something here in my home state because I love it dearly. Before I turn it back over to my father-in-law, here’s what I want to say. We are two and O, but what do you say we go three and O, guys?Let’s do it. I love you guys. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (00:09)
Oh, those polls, if you believe in those polls, Lara. But she also explained I love my family. I love your son. I love those beautiful children and I have to take care of them. And there’s something very refreshing about that. I don’t hear that from everyone. Sadly, I hear a lot of the opposite actually, but that’s why you’re such a special part of the family because you look at the numbers and you look at the polls and the love that this state has for you. It’s incredible. So thank you. And I’ve been putting a little pressure. I said, “Make your decision please,” because we have to pick somebody. And what I don’t want is I don’t want a lot of people joining a race that are big Trump supporters and then I have to go with somebody because there’s somebody in this room that I think is very special. Somebody that I’ve worked with, always been with me, always been with Mark and Deb and all of us.
Donald Trump: (01:04)
He’s a man that hasn’t been pushing me at all, unlike some of the others that are running, that won’t win. They won’t win. We have another race after this one. This man’s a great politician, but more importantly, he’s somebody that loves the state of North Carolina. He loves the country and I’m going to do it now, because again, I don’t want a lot of people running and then they’re going to be disappointed. And in many cases, they’re friends of mine. They’re great people, they’re thinking about running. They want to run and they wanted to wait, frankly, till Lara made her decision, because she would have been tough. She would have been tough.
Donald Trump: (01:37)
And she’s very outstanding, but I think she did the right thing for her and for our family. But this gentleman is going to be your next senator. He’s going to be somebody that you’re going to be so proud of. He will fight like hell, would you agree with that Mark? He will fight like nobody fights. And a lot of you don’t know him that well, but you’re going to know him probably within about two minutes. Ted Budd, please come up, please come up, please come up, Ted. I am giving him my complete and total endorsement. We’re going to work with him. We’re going to campaign with him. You can’t pick people that have already lost two races. You can’t pick people that have already lost two races and do not stand for our values. So I’m going with Congressman Ted Budd, complete and total endorsement. Come on up, Ted.
Ted Budd: (02:38)
Thank you Mr. President, thank you. Wow, Mr. President, thank you so much. And go back to 2016, I was in a 17 way race and won that primary and got here. I was the business guy that never run for office. I think maybe had an 18 way primary, right? 18 way. We came in and we fought for their forgotten men and women of America. And Lara, I think you’re out there, your father-in-law and you, you fought for me in 2018. The Dems outspent me two to one in the worst Republican district. And with your help, Mr. President and Lara, you coming in to help, we won. In 2020, Lara, we fought together. We fought to help Thom Tillis win, we fought to keep the North Carolina legislature, we fought for North Carolina judges. You’re a heck of a teammate and you’d be a heck of a Senator. Mr. President, Lara, this means the world to me. Thank you. We got a lot of hard work ahead. So let’s win this together and let’s get back to making America great again.
Donald Trump: (04:12)
Well, thank you very much, Ted. Honestly, he did not know about this until about 15 minutes before I walked to the podium and he was very taken by it. And I have read this on numerous occasions, so I’m not saying it myself, the wonderful… That’s a lot of media. That’s good. It’s hard for them to cancel when you get great ratings, isn’t it. They may edit that out. They don’t want to have that. They don’t like that. They may have to edit that out, Ted, but that’s okay. They don’t like those endorsements, but we’ve been very, very successful. Literally hundreds to one, hundreds to two in terms of the endorsements and the power of the endorsement, because people respect that I do want to make America great again. We were doing that. We were doing that at a level that nobody’s ever seen and putting America first ahead of China and ahead of all of these countries.
Donald Trump: (05:17)
And people know that, that’s where we were. And before the pandemic came into our shores, we were doing numbers. In history, there’s never been anything like it. Unemployment for everybody, for every group, everybody was the best it’s ever been. We’re up to 160 million people. We were never even close to a number like that. And then we had this horrible thing come in from China. And we got that one right too, by the way, do you notice, you see what’s going on over the last, it’s called the lab, that was an easy one. Wuhan. But you had this horrible problem come in. And like every other country, we went down and they were saying how well India was, look how well India is doing. Well, India is not doing too well now. And we’ve done an incredible job. And most importantly, with the vaccine coming up with it, but we’ve done an incredible job.
Donald Trump: (06:09)
So many things have happened and we built the economy not once, we built it twice, think of it because we built it. We had the highest stock market ever, the best job numbers. And then we had to regroup. We had to do a lot of things. We became the ventilator factory of the world. We were making them for everybody. Our cupboards were bare. The federal cupboards were bare and the state cupboards were bare and we’ve done a tremendous job. We never got the kind of credit that we deserve for that. One thing we do get the credit for, from everybody, even the other side, although they try and disparage it as much as possible, was the vaccine, coming up with a vaccine, but we did something else that people don’t talk about it. I made a bet and I shouldn’t call it a bet because maybe you say speculation, as opposed, but it was somewhat of a bet.
Donald Trump: (06:58)
We bought billions and billions of dollars worth of vaccine and all forms of getting that vaccine into your body. The needles, the bottles, the whole thing. We bought millions and billions actually of dollars worth of the vaccine. And we saved a period of a year, maybe more, you wouldn’t have the vaccine right now. This room would be empty because they would ask me to be here and I would say, “No, thank you.” And you would say the same thing. This would be an empty room right now. And your state would be in a lot of trouble and the country would be in a lot of trouble because you wouldn’t have the vaccine until probably October. It might’ve even been later than that. And one of the things I’m most proud about is we did the vaccine, developed the vaccine, and I pushed the FDA. They have never been pushed would you say, Mark Meadows?
Donald Trump: (07:46)
They have never been pushed like that. He was there at a lot of those meetings. Those were not nice meetings. They do not like me too much, that I can tell you. And frankly, the drug companies don’t like me too much either because I did a thing called favored nations where we have to pay whatever the lowest is in the world. That’s what we have to pay. Nobody can believe I instituted that. If they leave it alone, you’ll soon have the lowest drug prices that we’ve ever had by… But that doesn’t mean that they like me. They spend millions of dollars against me and that’s okay. They have to do what they have to do, but we did things that nobody has ever done. I’m very proud of the biggest bet. This was maybe the greatest bet ever made in the history of the world because we saved a year.
Donald Trump: (08:26)
We bought billions of dollars of this vaccine before we even knew it worked. And because of that, most of you, I guess, all of you, just about, in one form or another, you’ve had your shots or jabs as they like to call it. I actually like the other word better, but we’ve saved a lot of lives. We’ve saved all over the world. We’ve saved millions and millions of lives and we’re very proud of it. And nobody can ever take it away from us because that’s something that’s very, very special. And the people in this room are very, very special. The Biden administration seems to be putting America last. You look at these negotiations where so many bad things have happened. 48,000 jobs were lost by president Biden’s day one rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. Why? For what reason did they do that?
Donald Trump: (09:21)
And if you like the environment, the pipeline is much better than railroad tracks and it’s much better than trucking. It’s great. And they ended it on just about day one, 48,000 jobs, not 8,000. They said 8,000, it’s 48,000. Think of it. He rejected our pipeline, but he approved the Russian pipeline, which I had completely stopped going into Germany and all parts of Europe. So I stopped Russia and I have a very good relationship with President Putin, but there’s never been anybody as tough on Russia than I was. And you look at these horrible cyber attacks. You look at all of the things that are happening. We’re in a different world than we were in just a few months ago. Yet there’s no better example of Biden’s failed agenda than the catastrophic, and you look at it what’s going on with the southern border. Is there anything that you’ve ever seen, like what’s going on, on the southern border? And people are coming in from South America, Latin America, but they’re coming in from the Middle East.
Donald Trump: (10:24)
They’re coming in from all over. When I left office, we gave the new administration the most secure border in US history. We had the most secure border in the history of our country and that included drugs, that included human trafficking, which is a magnificently horrible and big business, mostly trafficking in women. And the numbers were down to levels that they hadn’t seen in many, many years. And all they had to do is just leave it alone. Just leave it alone. If you leave it alone, it would have gotten better and better. And the fact that we built almost 500 miles of wall, and just a few months, it would have been completed, took two and a half years of litigation to get to build the wall and what an impact it had. But it would have been completed, totally completed in just a couple of months.
Donald Trump: (11:18)
And they stopped it. Now I understand they’re starting it again. That one was just too easy, but wait till they find out, hey, wait till they see what those contractors are going to do to them. Well this is going to cost us five times more money now because we weren’t prepared. It’s the old story. They’re the greatest negotiators in the world. They may not have gone to the greatest business schools, but they’re the greatest negotiators. But we negotiated historic agreements with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, to stop illegal immigration. We ended asylum and asylum fraud. The fraud of what was going on at our border was unbelievable. We instituted rapid removals on the border and that’s really rapid. I call it one day turnaround of criminals coming into our country, sending people home in record time. We have times that nobody ever heard of before. We ended catch and release.
Donald Trump: (12:17)
That’s where you catch somebody, could be a horrible criminal. You catch somebody, a rapist, a murderer, could be a drug dealer. And we release them. It’s called catch. We catch them and we release them into our country. Well, we didn’t do that. We empowered ICE to do their jobs. ICE is incredible. The border patrol is incredible. By the way, your police force in North Carolina, I’ve gotten to know very well. They are incredible. Thank you very much. A lot of them are here tonight. We cracked down on sanctuary cities, deported gang members by the thousands, and dealt a crippling blow to MS-13, that’s the most vicious gang of all. And we took them out of here by the thousands. Thousands and thousands brought back to where they came and those countries didn’t want them back. And a little story. I said, “Well, what do you mean they don’t want them back?”
Donald Trump: (13:15)
They weren’t taking them back. They didn’t want them back. They sent them out. They didn’t want them back. And I said, “That’s bad.” And they told me that, “Sir, we can’t take them. They won’t let us land planes. They’re putting other planes on the runway. So we can’t land planes. They won’t take the buses.” I say, “How much do we pay those countries?” “Sir, we pay them $500 million a year.” “Oh, you do? Tell them we’re not paying them anymore.” And the next day I got a call from all three countries. “We’d love to have Ms-13 back. We think they’re wonderful people. We never had a problem.” And now they blew that one too. They blew that one too. I’ll never forget it. “We’d love to have them back. It would be a great honor to take them back.” Those runways opened up like you’ve never seen anything open up.
Donald Trump: (13:59)
After we instituted these policies, the number of illegal aliens coming across our border declined by an astounding 91%. But under Joe Biden, illegal crossings are up nearly 1000% compared to the same period last year. They’re emptying their prisons. They’re sending murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers, and others just as bad to the United States. Let the United States take care of them. Remember it’s called America last. In April alone, over 175,000 illegal aliens were apprehended and mostly released. You know where they were released, right? They were released into our country and we saw the largest number ever of unaccompanied minors. We’ve never seen anything like it. If you just watch some of the semi-fair tell. You don’t have to watch fair, semi-fair. They talk about it. Because I think they have no choice and I think they’re going to see it more and more.
Donald Trump: (14:56)
You don’t see it too much on the evening news yet, but you’re going to see it because they’re destroying our country, but it is much worse than that because there are at least 1000 aliens who are simply getting away every single day as the radical Democrats have intentionally, ruthlessly, and systematically dismantle the sovereign borders of the United States of America. We have people just walking into our country. Nobody knows who they are, where they’re from. There’s no vetting, there’s no anything. And some of these people are very, very bad people, much as I said on that beautiful morning when I came down with our future first lady at the time, Melania, who sends her regards. But we came down that beautiful gold escalator in Trump Tower and I made that statement and people hated it. It turned out that my statement was very minor compared to the actual facts.
Donald Trump: (15:59)
It was very, very minor. It’s another thing we were right about. Without a border, you cannot have a nation, certainly not a great nation. We fight for other country’s borders, but we don’t fight for our own border. Think of it. We fight for other country’s borders, but not for our own. That changed under my administration but now they’re going back more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible. Nobody ever thought that they could do this kind of destruction to our country so quickly. Some of those executive orders that are signed are absolutely insane. Biden has halted wall construction, suspended removals, and even removals of just horrible, horrible people, stopped enforcement, shredded our groundbreaking remain in Mexico. So we had that groundbreaking plan that took us a long time to get, because Mexico, like the other countries, were taking advantage of the United States. Everybody was taken advantage of us and we have an agreement. Stay in Mexico as opposed to stay in the United States.
Donald Trump: (17:11)
And a lot of people weren’t coming when they realized they had to stay in Mexico. So the enforcement was so much better and it was getting to a level that nobody’s ever seen. And then we finally hit that level. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. They turned America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens and effectively, they were abolishing ICE through agency directives. What they’ve done to ICE and what they’ve done to our border patrol heroes is incredible. It’s incredible. And these are some of the finest people you’ll ever meet. I got to know so many of them and they’re among the finest people you’ll ever, ever meet. It’s true. They love our country. Despite the worst border crisis in history, we’ve had the smallest number of illegal alien removals ever.
Donald Trump: (18:03)
… had the smallest number of illegal alien removals ever recorded. 92% of illegal aliens we removed in 2020 had criminal records. You believe that? Over 90 and very substantially probably higher than that. I think around 92% had criminal records. Now, they’re all being set free and released back into your communities. They don’t want to bring them back. If they are back, they actually have a new policy that, if we took them out, they’re going to let them come back in. It’s the most incredible thing I’ve ever heard.
Donald Trump: (18:34)
But the border is just the beginning of the Biden disasters. As you know, we handed the new administration the greatest economy in the history of the world. We passed massive tax cuts. The largest ever. Larger than our great friend, Ronald Reagan. Record regulation cuts, historic pro-American trade deals, and achieved American energy independence. How’s your gasoline price doing? Actually, I guess, you were hit worse than any state from what I understand on the cyber attack. It’s incredible. It’s a lack of respect. After the pandemic began, we launched the fastest economic recovery on record. We produced three vaccines and numerous therapeutics to defeat the virus. They don’t talk about the therapeutics, but we came up with things that are incredible and I think extremely effective. All Joe Biden had to do was sit back and do nothing and it was taking off like a rocket ship. Nobody’s ever seen it between the economy and all of the other things we did, the border. Instead the economy is going to Hell and inflation is going to cause a catastrophe in the near future. The New York Times, who I don’t often quote, just stated 1,000,000 jobs a month seemed within grasp not long ago. Think of it, 1,000,000 jobs a month seemed within grasp not long ago, but now it looks like wishful thinking. Isn’t that sad? Now, we would have done much better than that. But that’s the New York Times saying it. Monthly jobs numbers have missed expectations the last two months in a row and you saw what was released on Friday. They were devastating numbers, job numbers. Inflation is now at the highest level in 13 years and it’s going to go up very substantially. It’s going to cost you a lot more. Imposing a stealth tax on hard-working Americans and especially on middle income Americans. Biden re-entered the job killing Paris Climate Accord, a terrible deal that is pro-China, pro-Russia, and anti-American and will cost America trillions of dollars over the years. This is a deal that is so one-sided against us like practically no other deal. But they’re all bad, but this one’s a real beauty. But it sounds so nice, right? The Paris Environmental Accord. Gas prices have increased almost 71% since one year ago. Think of it.
Donald Trump: (21:18)
Democrats are now attempting to pass the largest tax hike in American history and it will affect everybody. They’re saying it’s against the rich. It’s against everybody. A lot of the rich will take off to go to other countries. A lot of the companies that I brought back are going to leave and go back to other countries where they can not have to pay all of their profits out in taxes. They’re talking about the biggest tax hike in history by far.
Donald Trump: (21:43)
They’re also pushing a $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill that’s not infrastructure. It’s the kind of things that you don’t want. 9% looks like it might be infrastructure, but mostly it’s not infrastructure at all. The Democrat legislation also includes an extreme plan to abolish single family home zoning, which would obliterate your home values, increase crime, and destroy the suburbs all to satisfy the far-left agenda of AOC, Bernie Sanders, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, who is telling us how to run our country. It’s a great experience. She comes from a country that’s done a wonderful job running their country. Now, she’s telling us how to run our country. While Democrats push economic policies designed to punish American workers, Republicans must keep on fighting to protect, promote, and uplift the American worker who we cherish.
Donald Trump: (22:53)
That begins with standing up to Communist China. Last year, China inflicted an estimated $ 16 trillion of economic damage onto the United States with a virus that I call the China Virus because I want to be accurate, that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens. Look at the world. Look at what happened to the world. It’s not just us. It’s the world. Had we not come up with a vaccine, you would have had a 1917 Spanish Flu number. They lost, they say, up to 100 million people. You would have had those kind of numbers. You would have had numbers that are just unthinkable. But because of what we’ve done as a nature and because of the speed that we came up with a vaccine, the world will not have that. Many places in the world are getting better. Even India today announced that they’re starting to heal.
Donald Trump: (23:51)
The media, the Democrats, and the so-called experts are now finally admitting what I first said 13 months ago. The evidence demonstrates that the virus originated in a Chinese government lab. Couldn’t say it. You couldn’t say it. Dr. Fauci, who I actually got along with, he’s a nice guy, he’s a great promoter. Not a great doctor, but he’s a hell of a promoter. He likes television more than politician in this room and they like television. But he’s been wrong on almost every issue and he was wrong on Wuhan and the lab also. Very wrong. We ended the payments. They were started in 2014 and then I can tell you Mark Meadows came in and I talked to him and he saw what I saw. I said, “What the hell’s going on? When did that start?” It started in 2014 and we ended it, our administration ended it.
Donald Trump: (24:50)
But generally speaking, I went the opposite way of Dr. Fauci, what he was saying. For instance, Fauci said, “Do not close our borders to China or Europe,” but I did it anyway. Months later, he said I made the right decision and saved thousands and thousands of lives. He said it was the right decision, but he did not want to close that border. I said, “Wait a minute, there’s tremendous infection over there. We can’t let this happen.” We closed it and I think we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. You remember the number? It was 2.2 million people in our country who were expected to die. Fauci said powerfully at the beginning no masks. You remember that? No, masks don’t work. Masks don’t. Then he went into masks and then he became a radical masker. I recall him… If you have three, if you have four. Get a pair of goggles also ideally. Let’s wear them for another five or six years.
Donald Trump: (25:48)
But Fauci has, perhaps, never been more wrong than when he denied the virus and where it came from. The time has come for America and the world to demand reparations and accountability from the Communist Party of China. We should all declare within one unified voice that China must pay. They must pay. The United States should immediately take steps to phase in a firm 100% tariff on all goods made in China. You saw what was happening with our tariffs. In fact, the Democrats were fighting the tariffs, “Oh, we don’t…” Well, he hasn’t taken those tariffs off. He doesn’t want to. Billions and billions of dollars. 25% tariffs on China. Billions and billions of dollars is pouring in.
Donald Trump: (26:51)
Frankly, if you raise them, a lot of things would happen to China. I think they’d stop building their military. I think a lot of companies would move back to the United States. I’m not only talking about China. I’m talking about others. Because you know what China does is they’ll sell through other countries. They’re very ingenious. They’re very smart. Had a great relationship with President Xi until the China Virus came in and it was real tough.
Donald Trump: (27:16)
We made a tremendous deal for the farmers. Farmers are doing better than they’ve ever done because of us, because of me, because of what we’ve done with our administration. Better than they’ve ever done. Look at wheat prices and virtually all prices. The farmers are doing the best and one of the reasons is China is buying tremendous amounts. They want to keep us happy. They want to keep me happy. I don’t think they want to keep Biden happy. I don’t think they care too much about Biden to be honest. But they wanted to keep me happy and they were investing with our farmers. They were buying so much of our product and they continue to do so. We made a great deal.
Donald Trump: (27:49)
But after the virus came in, I just felt differently. A trade deal with China didn’t mean very much. To me, it was a whole different mindset. Does that make sense? I used to talk about the trade deal. I’d drive these guys crazy. That trade deal was great. Look at our farmers. They’re starting to do great. You look at beef, you look at cattle, you look at all of the different things. Corn, wheat. You look at it. What a great deal. When the virus came in, I don’t even talk about the trade. This is the first time in a long time I’ve even mentioned the trade deal. It’s really been very beneficial. But it’s so tiny compared to the devastation that’s been caused. We should reinvest 100% of all of that money that we collect from tariffs to help bring back jobs and factories from China and other places back to America and back to the great state of North Carolina where they belong.
Donald Trump: (28:46)
Over the years, I’ve built lots of hotels and lots of things. I used to buy my furniture from North Carolina. Are you a furniture guy? Stand up. There’s only one in the room I think. Right? But I helped you a lot, right? Good. Thank you. It’s great to have you. The quality was incredible. Now it’s so much of it’s made in China, right? So much. We were stopping that. It was all stopping. Then we had to slow it down a little bit after the pandemic, but it was all stopping. It was all starting to come back here and to other places. I will tell you, I bought a lot of furniture, a lot of things. A lot of times, you’d put furniture made in China into a hotel room and it would break. Somebody sits down in a chair. If you don’t sit down lightly, the damn thing would collapse. Then I’d get sued as usual. But nobody ever made it like you made it here and you make it here. So just stay tuned, okay? Because we were all set to bring it all back. It was all coming back.
Donald Trump: (29:47)
In addition, all nations should work together to present China a bill for a minimum of $10 trillion to compensate for the damage they’ve caused. That’s a very low number. The damage is far, far greater than that. As a first step, all countries should collectively cancel any debt they owe to China as a down payment on reparations. The nations of the world should no longer owe money to China. China has destroyed so many nations. I mean, we came out better than anybody. Our economy’s stronger now than any other nation. Nobody’s recovered like us because of what we’ve done, because we laid a great economic foundation, and because of what we’ve done with a vaccine and also what we’ve done with the distribution of the vaccine. But China should owe money to the nations of the world. They’ve been destroyed. These nations have been destroyed.
Donald Trump: (30:45)
Sadly, the current administration is very timid and frankly corrupt when you look at all of the money that they’ve been given as a family by China. That, instead of holding China accountable, the Biden Administration shut down the US government’s investigation into the origins of the virus shortly after taking office. What’s going on? Now, Hunter, who had no experience, walked out with $1.5 billion to manage. You know how much money you make on $1.5 billion to manage? They needed Hunter’s advice. They don’t use the smartest people on Wall Street. They don’t want their advice. I spoke to somebody on Wall Street. I won’t mention his name. We’ll get him in trouble. But I spoke to somebody. I said, “Who’s one of the biggest?” I said, “Do they do this?” He said, “I can’t get money.” This guy’s record is better than anybody. Now, that’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (31:34)
We must never forget that Joe Biden and his family took millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party. They bought them off. They flagrantly lied about it to the American voters. If you remember, it was a big deal at the time and then all of a sudden, it was canceled. They didn’t want to talk about it. The Big Tech and the fake news media didn’t want to talk about it. You could talk up a storm. In fact, I’ll guarantee you those cameras are starting to go off right now. It’s true. Yeah. Those red lights. Well, there’s one over there. What the hell network are you with? This guy’s going to lose his job. The American voters and now Joe Biden are doing… What they’re doing is just terrible to the American voter and to our great country, our great country.
Donald Trump: (32:27)
Because we are greater than China. There is nobody like us. Nobody has the people that we have. Nobody has the genius that we have. Nobody has the things or the system that we have when it works, but it’s broken right now. It’s corrupt. It’s broken. Whether it’s elections, whether it’s business, whether it’s taxation. Whether it’s so many different things. Nobody has what our country has. The Biden Administration has been one shameful and embarrassing foreign policy disaster after another. You know the former Secretary of State, he said, “Joe has never made a good foreign policy decision.”
Donald Trump: (33:09)
Biden cravenly lifted sanctions on Iran. Oh, Iran. Oh. I would have had a deal in one week. One week. I even told them. I said, “You know what? Let’s get the election over with and we’ll make a deal.” It would have been a great deal. Now, they’re actually asking for money. Here we go again. Remember? They got $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash. Now, they’re actually asking for money. They never asked me for money. It’s unbelievable. It’s so sad to see. So many things. That’s one.
Donald Trump: (33:40)
Look at what’s happening with North Korea. Remember when I first came in? We were going to war with North Korea. War is inevitable. Nuclear war we’re talking about. He’s pretty well stocked up and I got along with him. It started out a little rough, but we got along great. I liked him, he liked me. We got along great. You don’t even hear about North Korea. Now, you’re starting to hear. Because he doesn’t seem to like Biden very much. There’s nobody to talk to Kim Jong-un. He’s a different kind of guy. Takes a different kind of a guy to talk to him too, but I got along with him. Got along with him. Remember when I had the meeting? They said, “He’s given so much. He’s given…” I said, “I haven’t given anything.” They said, “Hmm, that’s a problem. All right.” Then they said, “No, no. You agreed to meet.” I said, “Well, what the hell is that? It’s a plane trip and it’s back and forth.” That’s okay.
Donald Trump: (34:38)
But you know the sanctions were all left. Nobody’s ever been sanctioned like them. Or Russia, by the way. Russia. Not only the pipeline, but Russia, look at the sanctions on Russia. Nobody’s ever, yet I got along great with Putin. But I got along great with Kim Jong-un. Got along great with everyone. Not all of them liked me. Germany’s ripping us off on trade. They understood that. So when I want to reduce 52,000 soldiers, take out 25,000 soldiers, which costs us just tens of billions of dollars, everyone goes crazy. But I did the right thing and they would have done anything, but now they want to put everybody back. It’s a shame.
Donald Trump: (35:15)
Biden’s also beholden to America’s enemies and so beholden, nobody’s ever seen anything, that he actually criticized Israel while the Jewish homeland was under attack by thousands and thousands of rockets and missiles launched by Iran. It was launched by Iran. It was a betrayal of Israel when you look at what happened in Congress. It used to be, 10 years ago, 12 years ago, 15 years ago, everybody was with Israel. Today, I guess it’s just not in vogue. But look at some of these radicals that they have in the House of Representatives, you have to deal with them all the time. Israel’s almost out. It’s almost out. It’s a very, very-
Donald Trump: (36:03)
… out. It’s almost out. It’s a very, very terrible thing, and Biden foolishly eliminated the travel ban on terror-afflicted countries. I said, “I don’t want people in from countries that blow up each other. I don’t want them in. I don’t want people in that are going to blow up our shopping centers. I don’t want people in that are going to blow up our cities.”
Donald Trump: (36:20)
And I won in court. They said I didn’t win, and they were right. I lost at the lower court, I lost at the second court, and then I won at the Supreme Court, or we have a travel ban, and now they want to give it up. When the press talks about the travel ban, do you ever notice that, “He lost him court”? And they’re right. I lost here, I lost there. And then I won. We got the travel ban. They don’t mention the last one, but we have a travel ban, and they are ending the travel ban, as I understand it. So they don’t mind people coming in that like to blow things up and kill people.
Donald Trump: (36:52)
And he’s taking action to increase the number of refugee admissions by 700%. This is [inaudible 00:37:01] stuff. But it’ll soon be by over 2,000% and that’ll go up and up and up, and I don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t need them for voting. And a lot of people say they want them for voting, but they don’t need them because they cheat so much in the voting you don’t have to go through this process. Okay? They don’t need them. I keep saying, “They don’t need them for voting. They just throw the ballots in there. Why do we need people coming in? We don’t need that. We’ll just throw those ballots in there,” and many other things.
Donald Trump: (37:29)
Yep, they’re destroying our country, and now Biden is being openly mocked by China’s negotiators and Russian president Putin. And they’re taunting him and they’re laughing at him and they’re humiliating our country. And do you ever notice when he had a hard time going up the stairs on the plane, nobody talks about that. Nobody talks. The news didn’t cover. Not one network covered it. Now, when I made the best speech I’ve ever made, they said it was at West Point and it was pouring, and I a ramp that was an ice skating rink. And I called, I said to the general, I said, “General, I may have to grab you, because the last thing I’m doing is going down.”
Donald Trump: (38:07)
So I walked gingerly down. That was on every newscast in the world, and I never went down. I never went on my ass, I’ll tell you. I wasn’t going to fall. I think that was a booby trap. I’ll never forget that ramp. That was like a sheet of ice. It was cold, rainy, and that ramp was long and steep. I said, “General, I might have to grab you, but I’m not going down under.” And unfortunately, I wasn’t wearing American shoes. I had Italian shoes, nice leather. Leather. It’s like an ice skating rink, but they made that a big story, but they didn’t make the Biden fall, the triple fall. I call it the triple fall.
Donald Trump: (38:47)
Under my administration. America was respected again, totally respected. We withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We stood with Israel, recognized Jerusalem as its eternal capital, and recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 55 years and I got it done. We decimated the ranks of the world’s top terrorists. You know that. We got our allies to pay their fair share. We stood up for our freedoms and for our country. And we stood up to America’s adversaries, like never before.
Donald Trump: (39:29)
Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. I got other countries with NATO to pay. We were paying for NATO. We were paying for NATO. I got them to pay $430 billion. Nobody knows. Nobody. You don’t read about that. The head of NATO is probably my single biggest fan, the secretary general of NATO. They couldn’t believe. So we were getting ripped off on trade. Okay? And on top of it, we were protecting them militarily. And how about Germany? They pay Putin, they pay Russia billions of dollars for energy. And then we protect Germany from Russia. How does that work?
Donald Trump: (40:09)
Think of it. They pay Russia billions and billions for the pipeline that nobody even knew was being built until I started making it a big case, because I said, “Why are you doing this? You’re paying them billions of dollars, and then we’re protecting you from them. What the hell kind of a deal are we? What are we doing?” It’s not believed. I could name so many. I could say so many different things. South Korea. I got them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year. They hadn’t paid for years and years and years anything substantial. And my deal was, they’re going to pay billions of dollars and it would have already taken place. And I refused to renew the deal. The deal expired. He knows better than anybody. I said, “We’ll go on a month-to-month basis.” Do you believe it? “We want a five-year deal.” I said, “No, no, no, because you’re not paying us. Why are we protecting you? You took our television business, you built the ships, you built everything, you’re making a fortune and you’re not paying us for military protection, and we’re protecting you against a very hostile nation. Why?”
Donald Trump: (41:11)
And they were very angry. They’re great negotiators. But finally, they agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was because their budget had already been passed. I said, “That’s okay, but in January, February, we’re going to meet and you’re going to pay us $5 billion a year,” and they said, “No, no, no,” but I can tell when they’re about ready to fold. So we didn’t renew the deal, and we were going to get billions and billions of dollars from South Korea, who we protect. And they’re great. They’re wonderful. Everything’s wonderful. But we were being taken advantage of.
Donald Trump: (41:45)
Again, kill us on trade and kill us on the military. And what happened? They just renewed it for a cost-of-living increase. Think of it. A cost-of-living increase. So we’ve been protecting them for 85 years, and they’ll pay if you ask them. Nobody asks. In fact, they said. I said, “Why are we paying for your military?” “Because that is the way it has always been.” Well, that’s not a great answer, I didn’t think. I said, “But that won’t be the way.” But I guess he turned out to be right, because they just got a cost of living, think of that, a cost-of-living increase of less than 1%.
Donald Trump: (42:24)
We would have gotten at least $5 billion from them. We fully rebuilt the U.S. military and created the first new branch of the United States armed forces in 75 years, called the Space Force, so desperately needed. A lot of people, a lot of things happening right here on this Space Force too. We ended the forever wars in Iraq and Syria and Somalia and Afghanistan. We brought them back home, and this is just the finishing little. We brought them back home. We’re down to very few soldiers in any of those places.
Donald Trump: (42:55)
And I’m very proud of it. These were the endless wars. So bad, so bad. I’d visit soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital, where the doctors are truly fantastic what they can do, but I’d see these young people that were just blown to pieces, and it’s so sad. I’d be at Dover where these magnificent machines would come in, the big cargo planes, and that door would open up and there’d be a coffin in the back. And the military, the soldiers, would take that coffin and walk it off the plane. And I’d be with the parents an hour before and we’d be talking, and I’d say to the general in-charge, “General, the parents seemed to be okay,” and he’d say, “No, they’re not, sir. They’re not okay.”
Donald Trump: (43:45)
I said, “General, I’m having a great conversation.” And the mothers oftentimes would say, “Oh, my son was such a great football player. Sir, he had an arm that was so powerful. He was so strong and he could throw a ball so far. He was such a good player,” or other things. They’d tell me these stories. They just were so in love with telling the stories about their son or their daughter, in some cases, their daughter.
Donald Trump: (44:08)
And then, I’d look at the general. I’d say, “Well, it’s amazing the way they can handle it.” And then, the plane would come in and the general would say, “Sir, it’s not going to be good.” And that door would open up, that big back door, right, would open up from this incredible, powerful machine that can lift up Army tanks like it’s nothing. And it would open up, and there’d be one or two or three or four coffins, and I’d see the same people that were talking to me so jubilant about their child, how great the child was, would start screaming, screaming. Screams like I’ve never heard before.
Donald Trump: (44:50)
It was the most terrible thing to watch. And the general in charge would say, “Sir, you’re going to see things that you maybe will not have seen.” “Like what, General?” He said, “Mothers and wives, and even fathers sometimes, breaking through the military ranks and jumping on top of the coffin.” And I got to see that one time where a mother, she was devastated. She jumped on and these incredible, extremely fit soldiers are taking that coffin, and would jump onto the coffin, and hey wouldn’t do a thing, they would just keep walking.
Donald Trump: (45:35)
And the mother was on the coffin, and this is for Afghanistan and for Iraq, and for these other places, where so many mistakes were made, where we shouldn’t be, and we can’t do that. And we’re moving them out. We’re moving them back. 21 years. You know, you’ve heard 19 years, but it’s not 19. Now it’s 21 years in Afghanistan. It’s enough. And we haven’t lost a soldier in Afghanistan since January of last year. Not one single soldier’s been lost. Pretty amazing. It’s pretty amazing.
Donald Trump: (46:15)
So it’s hard to believe the records the Biden administration is doing. And I’m very glad that he’s continuing to move them out. I think it would be very hard to stop, to be honest. I think, frankly, stopping would be very, very hard, but so I’m very honored by the fact that they’re continuing to bring those soldiers home where they belong. And we have other things to possibly get ready for, because the bigger ballgame, we have to be respected as a military power, because if we’re not respected, these other countries that are very big, very powerful countries, they will take advantage of us, and you know what I mean by that.
Donald Trump: (46:49)
So we cannot be doing what we’ve been doing for the last very long period of time. When we got into Iraq, I said, as a private individual, many years ago, “Don’t go. But if you’re going to go, keep the oil.” We didn’t keep the oil, and they make a lot of money with that oil. I know how much money they make. They make a lot of money. And we are looked upon as not very smart people and not a very smart country. So we’re doing things that nobody thought were possible. The radical Democrat Party has become consumed by the unquenchable thirst of power. You know that. I don’t know. It’s a term that I’ve heard for a long time. They want power, power, power. I don’t know. I think it’s power, it’s money. I think it’s a lot of things. I don’t think it’s just power. It’s too ridiculous. They want to take away freedom of speech. They want to take away religious liberty. And Biden has already introduced legislation in Congress to take away your guns. You know, your guns are under siege. You do know that. I told you all these things.
Donald Trump: (47:55)
Again, nobody ever thought what is happening would happen. In Texas, I said, “We’re going to win.” We won Texas by a lot. We won Texas, but they were against oil, guns, and God. And then you’d listen to the fake news. It’s going to be a very close race in Texas. It wasn’t very close at all. Republicans must never waiver in protecting the second amendment and keep and bear arms. We have to keep. We have to have that power to keep and bear arms. If we don’t, we will have a problem like nobody’s ever seen before.
Donald Trump: (48:33)
But they want to take away your guns. And I said it before the election and I say it after the election. The Biden administration has also issued regulations to indoctrinate America’s school children with poisonous and divisive left-wing doctrines, such as critical race theory, and exact opposite of the American belief that we all are created equal in the holy image of God. We have a group of people, I don’t know where they come from, but it’s hell, I think.
Donald Trump: (49:03)
Just as the state house of representatives has done right here in North Carolina, Republicans at every level should move immediately to ban critical race theory in our schools. And we should ban it in workplaces. We should ban it in our states, and we should ban it in the federal government, that it should be done immediately. It should be done very quickly.
Donald Trump: (49:41)
Washington Democrats are also pushing legislation to spend billions and billions of dollars on phony civic education, giving students academic credit to show up at protests. Can you believe that? And make themselves into left-wing activists. And how badly do they treat people that tend to be on the right compared to people that are on the radical left? Look at what happened in Portland. Nothing’s happening with these people, and they do kill people and they burn down buildings and they go after federal buildings and nothing happens. And people are damn angry about it.
Donald Trump: (50:19)
If government-run schools are going to indoctrinate children with radical ideas, Republicans must immediately pass legislation to empower every parent in America to opt out of the insanity and send their child to the public private charter or religious school of their choice. The socialist Democrats quests for whatever it is they’re looking for, because nobody knows, I don’t even think they know, truly knows no bounds.
Donald Trump: (51:03)
The slander that they cause, they slander our country, disparage our founding, divide our children. And as we’ve seen time and time again in recent years, the left is willing to weaponize the law itself to persecute their political opponents. There are people in this room that have been persecuted. In New York, radical left prosecutors are right now spending vast amounts of time and money threatening families and trying to destroy the lives of innocent people, really, really good people, in their crusade to inflict pain on me, the radical left movement in New York.
Donald Trump: (51:43)
There’s no place where it’s worse or more corrupt. And most importantly, to stop our movement, 75 million voters plus, plus, plus. That’s what I say. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of radical-left Democrat money had been paid to these prosecutors in the form of campaign contributions. Go get Trump. Go get him. And now, a new group of far-left Democrats are seeking the prosecutor’s office, all fighting for who will be the toughest on Trump.
Donald Trump: (52:13)
They’re going to get elected, whoever’s the vicious the most tough. They don’t know anything about me. “We’re going to get Trump.” “What did he do?” “Well, we don’t know, but we’ll figure it out.” Washington Post reported the other day, they’ve gotten millions of pages of documents. Well, when did he do a deal? Did he do another deal? They’re going through every deal I’ve ever done, millions and millions of pages. If there’s a comma, mistake, if there’s a misspelling, it’s problems. You know what? It’s a disgrace to our country. It’s prosecutorial misconduct.
Donald Trump: (52:48)
They’re in search of a crime. It’s a fishing expedition, and the Supreme Court of the United States should not have allowed it to happen. Shouldn’t have allowed it. And they mentioned, it can’t be a fishing expedition. This is the ultimate fishing expedition. It’s been a five-year long witch hunt, hoax after hoax, Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, the Mueller hoax. Look at the Mueller scam. How well did he do before Congress? It wasn’t too good, was it?
Donald Trump: (53:19)
Lie after lie, corrupt investigation after corrupt investigation. Do you remember when they found out it was Hillary Clinton and the Democrats that paid for the dossier, the fake news dossier, the fake dossier? It was Hillary Clinton. And they got more than the great James Patterson. This guy, Christopher Steele, I don’t know who the hell he is, but he sure as hell hated me.
Donald Trump: (53:44)
It was a total phony deal paid for by the Democrats and crooked Hillary Clinton. And nothing happens to them. And by the way, where’s Durham? What happened to Durham? Where is he? Has anyone seen Durham? All of this for nothing. It’s a shame, it’s a shame. They do things a little bit differently. We’ll never let it happen.
Donald Trump: (54:03)
It’s a shame. They do things a little bit differently. We’ll never let it happen again. Now they just send the same information from the no collusion Mueller investigation to corrupt politicians in New York, they send everything that they’ve already gone over and over, send it into New York, let the radical left prosecutors go after Trump. Just give it a shot, they say, give it a shot. They failed in Washington. They failed all over the place. Between the impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two, all of these investigations, ah shit, we failed. Let’s send it to the radical left prosecutors in New York, maybe they can have more luck. They’ll never stop until November of 2024. They won’t stop. There’s no better example of the Democrat and media corruption than the 2020 election hoax. As you know, the evidence is too voluminous to even mention. All you have to do is read the article in Time magazine, cover story in Time magazine. I’m not a big fan, I was on the cover a lot, perhaps a record, a lot. I got to a point if I was ever on the cover, I was on the cover of Time magazine before I did this political thing and I read every word. I said, I wonder what that means. It was actually a very good story, I used to actually get good press, can you believe it? I guess that’s how I got to be president when you think about it. But I used to get great press. But Time magazine did a story. They couldn’t help themselves. They had to brag about what they did in November. They had to brag and that story just goes 25% of the way.
Donald Trump: (55:51)
But if you take it a little bit further, you’ll just read that and you see how corrupt, but that’s the least of it. You look at what happened on that evening when the election was won and all of a sudden vast amounts of votes were taken in just in certain states, swing states. Swing states that I was leading by a lot. Then all of a sudden, oh, something happened. It was a disgrace to our country and if you think people don’t see it, people see it. People have seen it. The 2020 presidential election, that election, the 2020 presidential election was by far the most corrupt election in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like this. They used COVID and they used the mail-in ballots to steal an election. It was the third world country election like we’ve never seen before. Look at what took place. I want to congratulate by the way, Republican state senators in Arizona and other places for their great work that they are doing in exposing this fraud.
Donald Trump: (57:08)
And maybe again, I have nothing to do with the Arizona situation, they’re doing it, the state senate of Arizona, because they have so many discrepancies, so many problems. And they’ve heard from so many people about the corruption and what took place, so they’re doing it. Let’s see what happens. They’ll be finished in three or four weeks. It’ll be very interesting, but I’ll tell you, and maybe they’ll find nothing. Maybe they’ll say, oh, it was a wonderful, perfect election, but maybe not. And now they’re looking at it in Pennsylvania and they’re looking at it in Georgia. And they’re looking at it in many other states because they’re saying the same things happened to us.
Donald Trump: (57:48)
That election will go down as the crime of the century and our country is being destroyed by people who perhaps have no right to destroy it. Zuckerberg broke the law spending millions of dollars. Don’t you think he broke the law? Millions of dollars to get out the vote efforts in highly Democrat areas. He used to come to the White House. He would call, “Oh, could I have dinner with you, sir?” “Sure.” “Could I bring my wife?” “Oh, absolutely.” He actually walked into the office one day in front of numerous people, “Congratulations, sir.” “Why?” He said. “You’re number one on Facebook.” He said to me, “You’re number one on Facebook.” I said, “Thank you very much. I appreciate it.” We had a nice dinner. The day I was out he became a rather, well, I guess it’s human nature. But we can’t let our country be run by that kind of human nature can we? Zuckerberg, it’s another beauty.
Donald Trump: (58:48)
But they say they may allow me back in two years. No, I’m not too interested in that. They may allow me back in two years, we got to stop that, we can’t let it happen. So unfair, they’re shutting down an entire group of people, not just me. They’re shutting down the voice of a tremendously powerful, in my opinion, a much more powerful and a much larger group. Because you know what, when the Democrats say defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, all of these horrible, horrible cancel culture things, their policy is terrible. And I say a lot now there’s no way they go 50, 50, who the hell wants to defend the police? Look at what’s happening where they’re defunding the police, the crime rate is going up by 50, 60, 100%. 131% in one city. They don’t even know what to do, but they keep doing it.
Donald Trump: (59:40)
The policy is so bad. You know what, they’re smart and I said, they’re vicious and they stick together. But I don’t believe it’s 50, 50 because our country isn’t there. We’re not a 50, 50 country to defund the police and to have sanctuary cities where criminals are allowed to be protected. I’m telling you, I think a lot of these elections where they always seem to have an advantage, I don’t believe it. I can’t believe that some of these states that are blue, that they’re blue. I know those people, they’re smart people. And I see so many people. They love me because they love what I stand for. And they’re not into these things. There’s something going on and we have to be very, very careful with our election process because I don’t believe we’re a 50, 50 nation where these states are split evenly. They can’t be split. This is corrupt elections possibly and we can’t allow it to go on.
Donald Trump: (01:00:37)
And I can tell you, and you’ll see it because more and more it’s coming out. The things that happened in the recent election, dead people voting, dead people. Worse is dead people voting who had to apply to vote. It’s true. You had people that are dead that applied to vote. And by the way, I’m talking about thousands of people, thousands and thousands of people, dead people. Illegal aliens voting. Indians getting paid to vote in certain states, including Arizona and Nevada, getting paid to vote. You’re not allowed to get paid to vote. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on. We have to clean up those rolls, we have to do so many things or we’re not going to have a country. If you don’t have election integrity and if you don’t have strong borders, our country can be run like a dictatorship and that’s what they’d like to do.
Donald Trump: (01:01:26)
I don’t even think Biden is the dictator. If anybody knows who the hell is running that operation, could you let us know? Because I don’t think it’s Joe but who the hell knows maybe it is. Maybe it is. And with all of the things currently going on, especially the prosecutorial misconduct that’s going on at a level like nobody’s seen for many, many years, that’s all that’s happening. And that’s what they’re doing. They want to silence you, they want to silence your voice. Remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I’m the one that’s trying to save it, please remember that. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:02:28)
We all know what happened with the election and we can never ever let that happen again. And we’re going to go forward and we’re going to continue to look, and things are being found that is not even believable. But we have to do that because without going back, you’re not going to go forward. The thing that I get most is, “Sir, we can’t let that happen again. If we’re going to work and work, and spend money, and make contributions. Sir, will the same thing happen in 2022 to Ted and to other people? Will the same thing happen has happened in ’20?” We have to be able to say absolutely not. That’s why I love what they’ve done in Texas. I love what they’re doing in Florida and done in Florida. I would like to see Georgia be much tougher, they don’t have signature verification, they don’t have things, that Georgia has to be tougher. But I love what’s going on in so many states, 41 different states. Because they saw what happened in this last disaster and they don’t want it to happen again.
Donald Trump: (01:03:34)
And the only way you’re going to be able to really solve that problem is to figure out exactly what happened. And you know what, they’re going to be able to do that. In light of so many outrageous wrongs, Republicans across the country are pursuing voting reforms to ensure election integrity. One of the biggest things that I hear is election integrity. Joe Biden called these common sense reforms un-American. But the thing that is really un-American is an election scam, that’s un-American. All over the world, they used to say, oh, they’re the land of the free, they have great elections. We don’t have great elections. We have elections like probably very few countries have. And that’s in a bad way, not in a good way. What happened to this country in that last election was a disgrace and it’s being laughed at, and viewed all over the world.
Donald Trump: (01:04:24)
And I can tell you, China is extremely happy about it. And Russia is extremely happy about it. They’re all very, very happy about it. Probably in order, I would say China and then I would say Iran, and then I would say many countries. I could go through a list of them, but China is certainly happy. Iran is certainly happy. And think of it, if the bill passed by the House Democrats, HR1, is ever signed into law, there will never be another fair election in our country. It can’t get worse but it would be almost as bad as the recent presidential election. To fully secure every future election, we must have photo ID, universal signature verification, citizenship confirmation, chain of custody, integrity controls, updated voter rolls for every election. You got to update those voter rolls, not people that have been dead for nine years.
Donald Trump: (01:05:25)
We can’t have illegal aliens allowed to vote. Strong protection of poll watchers, our poll watchers, our poor, poor poll watchers. What happened to them in Philadelphia, what happened to them in Detroit, where they were literally thrown out of election for days, and were actually afraid for their lives. And we can not have dropboxes paid for by Facebook and Zuckerberg. Where, by the way, massive numbers, 95, 96% of the vote is for Joe Biden, doesn’t happen. You ever see these dropboxes, some of them came back very late. They got lifted, taken. Where are they a day later? Where are they? Oh, they’re coming. Oh great, that’s wonderful. 96% for Joe Biden. We must eliminate the absurdity of mass mail-in voting and people should vote in person on Election Day. Not over weeks and months where all sorts of things can happen and they’re not good things for our country. And there should have to be a legitimate reason for someone to vote absentee. There are people that deserve it. They’re sick, they’re at a certain age, they can’t make it, and they love our country. There’s a certain group of people, military, but to do what you did, where you were sending out millions and millions…
Donald Trump: (00:40)
By the way, I don’t know if, those of you that are really into the world of politics, you know that I called this long before what I heard what they were doing, how they were allowed to do this. Millions and millions of ballots, some people got six, some people got seven ballots. To send out millions of ballots, to allow that to happen to our country… We know the radical left will stop at nothing in their efforts to destroy the America we love, but with the help of righteous American Patriots like all of you in this room, they will fail. Our movement is far from over. In fact, it is just getting started.
Donald Trump: (01:19)
Here in North Carolina, across the country ,the Republican party will continue to fight for strong families, safe communities, and secure and sovereign borders. We will fight for more jobs, lower taxes, and pro-American trade deals that result in more North Carolina workers, forging more products, stamped with beautiful, beautiful phrases, but in particular made in the USA, Mr. Furniture Manufacturer. We will shut down outsourcing, bring back our supply chains, crack down on trade cheaters and violators, and ensure that America, not China, dominates the future of the world. We will protect innocent life. We will defend our glorious constitution and we will uphold the Judeo-Christian values and principles of our nation’s founding.
Donald Trump: (02:28)
We will break up the big tech monopolies, reject left-wing cancel culture, restore free speech in America, and demand free, fair and honest transparent elections. We will strengthen our military, support our great police, and always take care of our amazing veterans. Do you know that we got a 92% approval rating with respect to the VA. They rated us 92% approval rating. It’s never been anywhere even near that number. Very proud of that. With the American pride that fills our souls, we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.
Donald Trump: (03:23)
Tomorrow marks the 77th anniversary of one of the most epic military trial in the history of the world, the allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day. As we remember this incredible achievement, let us summon the spirit of generations of Americans before us who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for our beloved country. All of us in this room inherit the legacy of the selfless patriots who won the battles, crossed the oceans, forged the steel, made the breakthroughs, climbed the summits, these great, beautiful summits, tamed the frontiers and seized the victories that built America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. That’s where we want to keep it. That is our magnificent American inheritance, and there is nothing like it anywhere in the world, and there never will be. Let us go forward tonight, moved by their sacrifice, motivated by their example, inspired by their resolve, committed to their values and more determined than ever to make America prouder, freer, stronger, and greater than ever before. Thank you, North Carolina. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

			Donald Trump: (01:24)
Well, thank you very much. And hello, CPAC. Do you miss me yet? Do you miss me yet? A lot of things going on.
Donald Trump: (01:36)
There’s so many wonderful friends, conservatives and fellow citizens in this room and all across our country. I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we’ve begun together, we went through a journey like nobody else. There’s never been a journey like it. There’s never been a journey so successful. We began it together four years ago, and it is far from being over. We’ve just started.
Crowd: (02:04)
USA USA USA USA.
Donald Trump: (02:11)
Our movement of proud, hardworking, and you know what? This is the hardest working people, hard working American Patriots is just getting started. And in the end we will win. We will win.
Donald Trump: (02:29)
We’ve been doing a lot of winning as we gather this week, we’re in the middle of a historic struggle for America’s future, America’s culture, and America’s institutions, borders, and most cherished principles. Our security, our prosperity, and our very identity as Americans is at stake, like perhaps at no other time.
Donald Trump: (02:56)
So no matter how much the Washington establishment and the powerful, special interests may want to silence us, let there be no doubt. We will be victorious. And America will be stronger and greater than ever before.
Donald Trump: (03:18)
I want to thank my great friends, Matt and Mercedes Schlep. Matt, thank you. Thank you. Mercedes, thank you very much. And the American Conservative Union for hosting this extraordinary event. They’re talking about it all over the world, Matt. I know you don’t like that, but that’s okay, all over the world.
Donald Trump: (03:39)
I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh who is watching closely and smiling down on us. He’s watching and he’s loving it and he loves Catherine. Catherine, thank you for being here, so great. Thank you Catherine. He loved you, Catherine. I will tell you that. Fantastic. Thank you Catherine very much.
Donald Trump: (04:15)
To each and every one of you here at CPAC, I am more grateful to you than you will ever know. We’re gathered this afternoon to talk about the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country. For the next four years, the brave Republicans in this room will be at the heart of the effort to oppose the radical Democrats, the fake news media, and their toxic cancel culture. Something new to our ears, cancel culture. And I want you to know that I’m going to continue to fight right by your side. We will do what we’ve done right from the beginning, which is to win. We’re not starting new parties. They kept saying, he’s going to start a brand new party. We have the Republican party. It’s going to unite and be stronger than ever before. I am not starting a new party. That was fake news, fake news.
Donald Trump: (05:22)
No. Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Let’s start a new party and let’s divide our vote so that you can never win. No, we’re not interested in that. No we have tremendous, Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody’s ever heard of before, more popular than anybody. That’s all of us. It’s all of us. Those are great numbers. And I want to thank you very much. Those are incredible numbers. I came here and he was giving me 95%, 97%, 92%. I said, they’re great. And I want to thank everybody in this room and everybody all throughout the country, throughout the world, if you want to really know that. Thank you though. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (06:02)
We will be united and strong like never before. We will save and strengthen America. And we will fight the onslaught of radicalism, socialism, and indeed it all leads to communism once and for all. That’s what it leads to. You’ll be hearing more and more about that as we go along. But that’s what it leads to. You know that. We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad. But none of us even imagined just how bad they would be and how far left they would go. He never talked about this. We would have those wonderful debates. He would never talk about this. We didn’t know what the hell he was talking about actually.
Donald Trump: (06:48)
His campaign was all lies. Talked about energy, I thought I said, “This guy actually, he’s okay with energy.” He wasn’t okay with energy. He wants to put you all out of business. He’s not okay with energy. He wants windmills, the windmills. The windmills that don’t work when you need them. Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history. That’s true. Already the Biden administration has proven that they are anti jobs, anti-family, anti borders, anti energy, anti-women, and anti science. In just one short month, we have gone from America first to America last. You think about it, right? America last. There’s no better example than the new and horrible crisis on our Southern border. We did such a good job. It was all worked. Nobody’s ever seen anything that we did. And now he wants it all to go to hell. When I left office just six weeks ago, we had created the most secure border in us history.
Donald Trump: (08:06)
We had built almost 500 miles of a great border wall that helped us with these numbers because once it’s up, they used to say, “A wall doesn’t work.” Well, you know what I’ve always said, walls and wheels. Those are two things that will never change. The wall has been amazing. It’s been incredible and little sections of it to complete, They don’t want to complete it. They don’t want to complete little sections in certain little areas. They don’t want to complete. But it’s had an impact that nobody would have even believed. It’s amazing considering that the Democrats’ number one priority was to make sure that the wall would never, ever get built, would never, ever happen, would never get financed. We got it financed. We ended catch and release, ended asylum fraud, and brought illegal crossings to historic lows. When illegal aliens trespass across our borders, they were properly caught, detained and sent back home. And these were some rough customers. I want to tell you some rough customers were entering our country.
Donald Trump: (09:16)
It took them the new administration only a few weeks to turn this unprecedented accomplishment into self-inflicted humanitarian and national security disaster by recklessly eliminating our border, security measures, controls, all of the things that we put into place. Joe Biden has triggered a massive flood of illegal immigration into our country, the likes of which we have never seen before. They’re coming up by the tens of thousands. They’re all coming to take advantage of the things that he said that’s luring everybody to come to America. And we’re one country. We can’t afford the problems of the world, as much as we’d love to. We’d love to help. But we can’t do that. So they’re all coming because of promises and foolish words.
Donald Trump: (10:11)
Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden’s decision to cancel border security has single-handedly launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and some of the most evil people on the planet. You see it every day, just turn on the news. You’ll see it every day. Under my administration, we stopped the child smugglers. We dismantle the criminal cartels. We greatly limited drug and human trafficking to a level that nobody actually thought was possible. And the wall helped us a lot. And we protected vulnerable people from the ravages of dangerous predators. And that’s what they are dangerous, dangerous predators.
Donald Trump: (10:58)
But the Biden administration has put the vial coyotes back in business and it has done so in a very, very big way. Under the new administration, catch and release has been restored. Can you imagine? We work so hard, catch, you know where that is? You catch them, you take their name, they may be killers. They may be rapists. They may be drug smugglers. You take their name and you release them into our country. We did the opposite.
Donald Trump: (11:29)
We not only didn’t release them, we had them brought back to their country. Illegal immigrants are now being apprehended and released along the entire Southern border, just the opposite of what it was two months ago. They weren’t coming because they couldn’t get in. Once they think they can get in, they’re coming. And they are coming at levels that you haven’t even seen yet, by the hundreds of thousands, by the millions they’ll be coming.
Donald Trump: (11:54)
The Biden administration is now actively expediting the admission of illegal migrants, enabling them to lodge frivolous asylum claims and admitting them by the thousands and thousands and thousands a day, crowded together in unsanitary conditions, despite the ongoing economic and public health crisis, COVID-19, or as I call it, the China virus.
Donald Trump: (12:26)
There’s no masks. There’s no double mask. That was a new one that came out two weeks ago. First Fauci said, “You don’t need masks, no masks, no good. No, no.” Then all of a sudden, you want them; and now he wants double masks. No social distancing, no nothing, no nothing. And together, and it’s sad actually. And it’s sad for them. And it sad for our country, what the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral, and indefensible, hard to believe it’s happening. Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive enforcing America’s laws. This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms and to lose the White House decisively four years from now.
Crowd: (13:28)
USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA.
Donald Trump: (13:59)
Actually, as you know, they just lost the White House. But it’s one of those things. But who knows, who knows? I may even decide to beat them for a third time. Okay? For a third time. True. Joe Biden defunded the border wall and stopped all future construction, even on small open sections that just needed to be finished up routine little work, it’s already been bought. Wait until the contractors get to them. And they say, “No, it costs us much more money not to finish this small section than if we finished it.” That’s going to be nice. Wait until you see those bills start pouring in.
Donald Trump: (15:01)
He revoked the executive order cracking down on deadly sanctuary cities. He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more. Let’s not deport people and restricting our law enforcement professionals. And they are great professionals. You have many of them represented here today, from conducting almost any immigration enforcement of any kind. The Biden policy of releasing criminals into the US interior is making America into a sanctuary nation where criminals, illegal immigrants, including gang members and sex offenders are set free into American communities.
Donald Trump: (15:45)
They have no idea who’s coming up. And remember with the caravans, these countries, not only the three of them, but many, many countries all over the world. They’re not giving us their best and their finest, because they’re intelligent. They’re not giving us their best and their finest. Remember I said that. I said that a long time ago, when I made the first remarks, when I came down the escalator with our great future first lady who says, hello, who loves you as much as I love you. But I said that a long time ago. And we turned out to be 100% correct.
Donald Trump: (16:29)
Biden’s radical immigration policies aren’t just illegal. They’re immoral. They’re heartless. And they are a betrayal of our nation’s core values. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening.
Donald Trump: (16:43)
The Republican party must hold Joe Biden and the Democrats accountable. They ripped up the diplomatic agreements we negotiated with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to shut down illegal immigration. They got a fortune, they got paid $500 million a year. When I came into office, those countries were refusing to take back illegal alien gang members, including MS 13, the most vicious probably of them all. No matter where you go in the world, MS 13, they do things that even the worst don’t think about. So I asked how much do we pay these countries? How much do we pay them? Sir, we pay them approximately $ 500 million a year. It’s a lot of money.
Donald Trump: (17:34)
I mean, it’s peanuts compared to the way other countries rip us off, but that’s a lot of money. I said, “Okay, we aren’t going to pay them anymore because they wouldn’t take back the criminals.” And this was true with the Obama administration. It was true for many, many years. So we’d catch a murderer. We’d want to bring them back to Guatemala, or Honduras, or El Salvador. They wouldn’t take them back. “No, we don’t want them.” We’d fly them in. They wouldn’t let the plane land. We’d bus them in. They wouldn’t let the buses get anywhere near the border.
Donald Trump: (18:08)
And I said, “We’re not going to pay them anymore.” So after I said that, and I stopped payment, like a term that we use in the world of business, let’s stop payment. So we stopped payment. They were delinquent. We stopped payment and they very quickly came to the table and we made a deal, very quick deal. We still kept the money. We still didn’t pay because… Or we made a deal.
Donald Trump: (18:38)
And when illegal aliens came across our border, they were rapidly deported and lovingly accepted by those countries from where they came. And it worked out great. So now they accept the people and that we ultimately got along very well with those countries, those three countries and many countries throughout the world, because they respected us again. They didn’t respect us. They couldn’t believe what they were getting away with. But now, Joe Biden has wrecked this great deal, wrecked it. And they’re already doing what they were doing before and they’re taking the money. And that’s just a small portion of what’s going on.
Donald Trump: (19:18)
To top it all off, the Biden people are pushing a bill that would grant mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens while massively expanding chain migration. That’s where you come in and everybody comes in, your grandmother, your father, your mother, your brother, your cousins. They come in so easily. So, so crazy. So crazy. It even requires that the US government provide a legal border crosses with taxable funded lawyers, lawyers, everybody need a good lawyer? You can’t have one. They get the lawyers, they get lawyers. They’re probably very good too.
Donald Trump: (19:55)
The Democrat immigration bill is a globalist corp. You take a look at the corporatist, big tech attack on hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. And Republicans must ensure that it never is allowed to become federal law, which is what they want to do.
Donald Trump: (20:18)
We must stand tall in the party. We have to do this. We have to stand tall as the party for law abiding Americans and others, when they’re in our country. Border security is just one of the many issues on which the new administration has already betrayed the American people. He didn’t talk about this stuff. I debated him. He wasn’t talking about this. What he signed with those executive orders, they weren’t things that were discussed. We didn’t know all about him and the press because they’re fake news. They’re the fakest fakers there are.
Donald Trump: (20:56)
The press refused to ask the questions. And when I asked the questions on television, on the debate, Chris Wallace, in this case, and others refused to let him answer. They refused to let them answer the questions. Maybe we could have found something. Or if the media did its job, which they don’t, they’re callous indifference to working family is equally clear when it comes to the critical matter of getting America’s children back to school. And they must get back and get back right now, right now, crazy. Terrible. Terrible.
Donald Trump: (21:49)
The Biden administration is actually bragging about the classroom education they are providing to migrant children on the border. While at the same time, millions of American children are having their futures destroyed by Joe Biden’s anti-science school closures. Think of it. We’re educating students on the border, but our own people, children of our citizens, citizens themselves are not getting the education that they deserve. There’s no reason whatsoever why the vast majority of young Americans should not be back in school immediately. The only reason that most parents do not have that choice is because Joe Biden has sold out America’s children to the teacher’s unions.
Donald Trump: (22:48)
His position is morally inexcusable. You know that. Joe Biden has shamefully betrayed America’s youth. And he is cruelly keeping our children locked in their homes, no reason for it whatsoever. They want to get out. They’re cheating the next generations of Americans out of the future that they deserve. And they do deserve this future. They’re going to grow up and they’re going to have a scar.
Donald Trump: (23:14)
It’s a scandal of the highest order. And one of the most graven acts by any president in our lifetimes. It’s the teacher’s union, it’s the votes and it shouldn’t happen. And nobody has more respect for teachers than I do. And I’ll bet you, a lot of the people within that union, they agree with everything I’m saying. Even the New York Times is calling out the Democrats. The mental and physical health of these young people is reaching a breaking point. Tragically, suicide attempts have skyrocketed and student depression is now commonplace and at levels that we’ve never seen before.
Donald Trump: (23:53)
The Democrats now say we have to pass their $1.9 trillion boondoggle to open schools, but a very small part of it has to do with that. You know where it’s going, it’s going-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
Well, part of it has to do with that, you know where it’s going, it’s going to bail out badly run Democrats, that is so much of it. But billions of dollars for schools remain unspent from the COVID relief bills that were passed last year. So on behalf of the moms, dads, and children of America, I call on Joe Biden to get the schools open and get them open now. They’re a great thing to do. When I left office and we’re very proud of this because this was something that they said could not be done. The FDA said it, everybody said it. Any article you read said it couldn’t be done. It would be years and years, I handed the new administration what everyone is now calling a modern day medical miracle. Some say, it’s the greatest thing to happen in hundreds of years, two vaccines produced in record time with numerous others on the way, including the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that was approved just yesterday.
Donald Trump: (25:15)
And therapeutic relief also, if you’re sick, we have things now that are incredible. What has taken place over the last year under our administration would have taken any other precedent at least five years. And we got it done in nine months. Everyone says five years, oh, five years.
Donald Trump: (25:40)
Can you imagine if you had to go through what all of the countries of the world who are now getting the vaccine or soon will be getting it from various companies, but can you imagine if all of those countries had to go through what they’ve been going through over the last year? You’d lose hundreds of millions of people. I pushed the FDA like they have never been pushed before. They told me that loud and clear. They have never been pushed like I pushed them. I didn’t like them at all, but once we got it done, I said, I now love you very much. What the Trump administration has done with vaccines has in many respects, perhaps saved large portions of the world. Not only our country, but large portions of the world.
Donald Trump: (26:38)
Not only did we push the FDA far beyond what the bureaucrats wanted to do. We also put up billions and billions of dollars, 10 billion to produce the vaccines before we knew they were going to work. It was called a calculated bet or a calculated risk. We took a risk because if we didn’t do that, you still wouldn’t have the vaccines. You wouldn’t have them for a long time. So think of that, we took this bet. We made a bet because we thought we were on a certain track, but you’d be starting to make them right now. It’d be a long time before you ever saw. It takes 60 to 100 days to manufacture and inspect new doses. And that means that 100% of the increased availability that we have now was initiated by our administration. 100%. In fact, the director of National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, he’s Fauci’s boss, actually, I think he’s a Democrat too, by the way, recently said that our operation warp speed was absolutely breathtaking and that the Trump administration deserves full credit, which we do. And as conservatives and Republicans, never forget that we did it. Never let them take the credit because they don’t deserve the credit. They just followed now, they’re following our plan, but this has been something that they really call, they call it an absolute miracle. Joe Biden is only implementing the plan that we put in place. And if we had an honest media, which we don’t, they would say it loud and clear. By the time I left that magnificent house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, almost 20 million Americans had already been vaccinated. 1.5 million doses were administered on my final day alone. 1.5 million in a day. Yet Biden said just a few days ago that when he got here, meaning The White House, there was no vaccine. He said, there’s no vaccine. Oh, good. Say it again, Joe. Now I don’t think he said that, frankly, in a malicious way. I really don’t. I actually believe he said that because he didn’t really know what the hell was happening.
Donald Trump: (29:28)
Never let them forget. This was us. We did this. And the distribution is moving along, according to our plan. And it’s moving along really well. We had the military, what they’ve done, our generals and all of the people, what they’ve done is incredible. But remember, we took care of a lot of people, including, I guess on December 21st, we took care of Joe Biden. Cause he got his shot. He got his vaccine. He forgot. It shows you how un-painful all that vaccine shot is. So everybody go get your shot. He forgot so it wasn’t very traumatic obviously, but he got his shot and it’s good that he got his shot. Last year, I predicted to you that the extremism, corruption and incompetence of the Biden administration would be literally unprecedented in American history. Unfortunately he has proven me 100% right. Already as president, Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation shredding your Second Amendment. Your Second Amendment is in far bigger trouble than you now, and for four years I fought like hell to save your Second Amendment. And we saved it 100%.
Donald Trump: (30:49)
We saved it. He signed an order to conduct politically correct far left indoctrination trainings in every department of the federal government, including the US military after I had terminated these horrible things that were being preached to our military and he wants it to go forward. It’s insane within his first few hours Biden eliminated our national security travel bands on nations plagued by terrorism. His first priority was to open our borders to un-vetted travelers from Libya, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and many other countries where strict vetting cannot occur. Countries that have tremendous problems. Countries with tremendous terrorism problems. We did it a travel ban. It was a real achievement.
Donald Trump: (31:43)
We told those countries, sorry, straighten out your act. We don’t want people coming in where they had an ideology or a problem. We just couldn’t have it. And it was incredible, how it worked was incredible. And he terminated it. We had to get it approved. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. We got it approved and he terminates it. In addition, he’s already increased refugee admissions by nearly 10 times, but in effect, it’ll soon be hundreds of times as millions of people flow up through our soon to be open borders. And by the way, the border patrol and ICE, these are some of the great heroes of our country. These are incredible people. I got to know them very well.
Donald Trump: (32:29)
Your families still cannot go out to eat at local restaurants. But Joe Biden is bringing in thousands upon thousands of refugees from all over the world. People that nobody knows anything about, we don’t have crime records. We don’t have health records. What are they bringing in with them? When I left office, we had virtually ended the endless wars, these endless wars, they go on forever. They go on forever. I would go to Dover and I would see caskets, coffins coming in. I’d see the parents and the wives and husbands. I would see the kids. Endless wars, 19 years in Afghanistan. We have it down to almost nothing left and I hear they might want to go back in. Iraq, remember I used to say, don’t go in, but if you’re going to go in, keep the oil, well, we went in and we didn’t keep the oil. We had made historic peace deals in the middle East. Like nobody thought were even possible with not a drop of bloodshed.
Donald Trump: (33:40)
And by the way, not one American soldier has been killed in Afghanistan in over a year. Think of that. Not one. Those troops have largely come home. At the same time, the new administration unilaterally withdrew our crippling sanctions on Iran, foolishly giving away all of America’s leveraged before negotiations have even begun. Leave the sanctions negotiated. Does anybody understand what I’m saying here? Are there any good business people? You don’t have to be a good, are there any bad business people? They took off the sanctions. They took off the sanctions.
Donald Trump: (34:35)
They say, well, we’re going to not have any sanctions. Let’s negotiate a deal. I don’t know, Matt Schlep. I don’t think you would have done that, do you think so, Matt? I don’t think so. Mercedes wouldn’t have. Now you do that, you make a deal and then you do what they want it. I will tell you something and I said it, had we had a fair election, the results would have been much different and we would have had a deal with Iran within the first week. They wanted those sanctions off. He took them off for nothing, for nothing. Now you watch how tough they negotiate. In another horrendous surrender he agreed to get back into the World Health Organization.
Donald Trump: (35:24)
For approximately $500 million a year, which is what we were paying. When I withdrew from the WHO and you know the whole story with that, they called it badly. They really are puppets for China. They called and they wanted us to stay in. I said, how much are we paying approximately $500 million? How much is China paying a much larger in terms of population country, sir, they’re paying $39 million. I say, why are we paying 500 million and they’re paying 39? I could tell you why. Because the people that made the deal are stupid, that’s why.
Donald Trump: (36:00)
And I had no idea how popular it was. I didn’t even know if I would be able to politically, because people were so happy when I did get out, but I said, so if we went in, we could get it for 39 million, which is what China, not 500 million, which is what we were stupidly paying. And they said, we can make a deal, we want you to go in, we can make a deal. Okay, and I decided not to do it, but we could have had it for 39. We could have had it for the same as China. And they decide now to go back into the World Health Organization and pay 500 million, what the hell is wrong with them? No, no, this is just emblematic.
Donald Trump: (36:46)
It’s a tremendous amount of money, but compared to trillions, it’s not, but it’s a tremendous amount of money. Why would China pay 39 million? And we’re paying almost 500 million. Why? So we could have made the same deal that China had 39 million. And they just say, we’re going back in. We’re going back into the World Health Organization. They go back in, they pay 500. It is so sad, just like the Iran and the World Health Organization, Joe Biden put the United States back into the very unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord without negotiating a better deal.
Donald Trump: (37:24)
They wanted us so badly back in. I’ll tell you they wanted us. I was getting called from all of the countries. You must come back into the Paris Accord. I said, tell me why, give me one good reason. First of all, China doesn’t kick in for 10 years, Russia goes by an old standard, which was not a clean standard and other countries, but we get hit right from the beginning would have cost us hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs. It was a disaster, but they go back in, I could have made an unbelievable deal and gone back in, but I didn’t want to do that. Surrendering millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to all of these other countries, almost all of them that were in the deal. So they have favorable treatment, we don’t have favorable treatment. And we just said, we’re going back in. To go back in, they wanted us so badly, you could’ve negotiated, if you wanted to go back in which frankly, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and everything else that we’ve ever had. So I don’t know why we have to.
Donald Trump: (38:23)
What good does it do when we’re clean, but China is not and Russia is not an India is not. So they are pouring fumes, you know the world is actually a small piece of the universe, right? They’re pouring fumes and we’re trying to protect everything and building products for three times more than is necessary. No, they could have made a great deal. If they were going to go back in, that’s fine. But they could have made a great deal and said, instead of just saying we’re back in. These people. And in one of his first official acts, which was incredible, because again, he talked about energy. He never said he was going to do this. He canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline destroying not the 8,000 or the 9,000 or the 11,000 jobs that you hear.
Donald Trump: (39:11)
But 42,000 great paying jobs on just about day one, right? He never talked about that during a debate because he wouldn’t have gotten away with it. Well, he would have, because they cheated so much, it probably wouldn’t have been. No, but that was not a topic of conversation. Remember fracking, you can frack. Oh, we love fracking. During the primary no fracking. As soon as he got through that, he said, no, of course everybody can frack. No fracking. You wait till you see what happens with your gasoline. Wait till you see what happens and we cannot let this stuff continue to go on. One of my proudest accomplishments as president was to make America energy independent, the United States became the number one energy superpower on Earth. Number one.
Donald Trump: (40:09)
Became number one. Bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia by a lot. We left them all in the dust. They were all in the dust. But if the Democrats have their way, we are heading from energy dominance to energy disaster. That’s what’s happening. You have to see what’s going on. Everything’s being closed up. It’s a disaster. The blackouts we saw in California last summer and all the time and the windmill calamity that we’re witnessing in Texas. Great state of Texas. We love Texas, but it’s so sad when you look at it, that’ll just be the start. How bad is wind power. So I talk about it all the time at CPAC, right? We went to CPAC. Remember last I said, we’re going to watch the president, well, Alice, the wind isn’t blowing. I don’t believe we’ll have any electricity. I remember we would kid, but I wasn’t actually kidding.
Donald Trump: (41:03)
It’s such an expensive form of energy. It’s so bad for the environment. It kills the birds. It destroys the landscapes. And remember, these are structural columns with fans on them. They wear out, and when they wear out all over the country, you see them, nobody takes them down. They’re rotting. They’re rusting, how this is environmentally good for our country. And it costs many, many times more than natural gas, which is clean and can fuel our great factories. Wind can’t do that. And solar, I love solar, but it doesn’t have the capacity to do what we have to do to make America great again, sorry it just doesn’t have it. Under the radical Democrat policies, the price of gasoline has already surged 30% since the election. And we’ll go to $5, $6, $7 and even higher.
Donald Trump: (42:01)
So enjoy that when you go to the pump and they’ll say that’d be about $200 to fill up your van. Remember they used to go to the little small vans. They got away from the big ones that everybody wanted. They went to the small ones. Well, you know what? Probably a good investment. As long as these guys have their say because you know, it’s a shame what’s happening. Energy prices are going to go through the roof. And that includes your electric bills. That includes any bill having to do with energy, our biggest cost. We will now be relying on Russia and the middle East for oil. And they talk about Russia, Russia, Russia. What’s better than what this guy has done for Russia. I had oil where they were actually paying you to take it. Okay. Remember they were going to give you 37 a barrel, but you had to take it away.
Donald Trump: (42:47)
You had free oil almost for a period of time and one way I was proud of it, but we also had to save the energy industry and it worked out well. And I dealt with Russia and Saudi Arabia and they cut back on production and we got it back up. But now it’s going the opposite because now they are taking this incredible energy independence away from the people of our country. And you’re going to see costs go like you have never seen them go before. It’s a very sad and very stupid thing that they’re doing. The Biden policies are a massive win for other oil producing countries and a massive loss for the United States and our great citizens, Joe Biden and the Democrats are even pushing policies that would destroy women’s sports.
Donald Trump: (43:28)
A lot of new records are being broken in women’s sports. Hate to say that ladies, but got a lot of new records, they’re being shattered. For years, the weightlifting, every ounce is like a big deal for many years. All of a sudden somebody comes along and beats it by a hundred pounds. Boom. Now young girls and women are in sets that they are now being forced to compete against those who are biological males. It’s not good for women. It’s not good for women’s sports, which worked so long and so hard to get to where they are. The records that stood for years, even decades are now being smashed with these. Smashed. If this is not change women’s sports, as we know it will die. They’ll end, it’ll end.
Donald Trump: (44:23)
What coach, if I’m a coach, I want to be a great coach. What coach, as an example, wants to recruit a young woman to compete, if her record can easily be broken by somebody who was born a man. Not too many of those coaches around, right? If they are around, they won’t be around long because they’re going to have a big problem when that record is we’re oh and 16, but we’re getting better. No I think it’s crazy. I think it’s just crazy what’s happening. We must protect the integrity of women’s sports so important after. And I don’t even know, is that controversial? Somebody said, well, that’s going to be very controversial. I said, that’s okay. You haven’t heard anything yet.
Donald Trump: (45:31)
As you can see, the early weeks of the Biden administration have nothing less than, they’ve been a catastrophe for American workers and for American families, the task of our mission. And for us, it’s our movement. As I said, a movement like has never been seen, I think we could probably say, never been seen anywhere in the world. And nobody’s ever seen a movement like this. I’d grow up and I’d watch somebody who came in second in New Hampshire or first in Iowa and that was the end. And they became famous for the rest of their lives. We won the election twice. I mean, think about it, twice. The task for our movement and our party is to stand up to this destructive agenda with confidence and with result, the future of the Republican party is as a party that defends the social economic and cultural interests and values of working American families of every race, color, and creed. That’s why the party is growing so rapidly and is becoming a different party. And it’s becoming a party of love. You have to see outside the streets. I mean, there’s such love. The flags. Amazing. That’s right now, it’s a party that’s incredible. The people, the spirit, and there are, as you probably heard a little while ago, I mean, there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been, including even before the election, more spirit now than we’ve ever seen, because people are seeing how bad it can be. And again, I want to thank Rush and Catherine, because what he did to get the word out has been incredible. Some people are irreplaceable as Sean Hannity would say and he said Rush is irreplaceable, but his spirit lives on. And that’s something that we need and we love. Republicans believe that the needs of every citizen must come first. In fact, America must come first. We don’t put it first.
Donald Trump: (48:03)
America must come first. We don’t put it first. They don’t put it first. Over the past four years my administration delivered for Americans of all backgrounds like never before, like never before. We built the strongest economy in the history of the world, raised wages and achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever, ever, ever recorded. It was so great for everybody of all backgrounds that even after the China virus, we are leading the world. Nobody’s even close. We’re leading it in the comeback. Our economic comeback has been incredible. That’s because the financial and economic foundation we built was so strong, that unlike other countries who are having a hard time, we didn’t break. We came roaring back, and now our stock market and your 401(k)s are again at record levels, higher than ever before, actually.
Donald Trump: (49:05)
Many people have asked, “What is Trumpism?” A new term being used more and more. I’m hearing that term more and more. I didn’t come up with it. But what it means is great deals, great trade deals. Great ones, not deals where we give away everything, our jobs, our money, like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever made, and we ended it. A lot of people forget, we ended it.
Donald Trump: (49:33)
Now we have the USMCA-Mexico-Canada. It’s incredible what it’s done for our farmers, who are doing fantastically. Did you see grain prices and grain sales are at an all-time high? Wheat, all-time high. So many elements of farms and farmers, and they love me. Remember, it’s going to be very close in Iowa. Well, it wasn’t close. We won in a landslide, Iowa, because our farmers know, and they put up with it, and we did a lot of work with the tariffs and all these things that we had to do to get it. Now the farmers are doing great, but they’re setting records.
Donald Trump: (50:08)
It means low taxes and eliminating job-killing regulations, Trumpism. It means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit. They come in and they can help us, as opposed to coming here and not being good for us, including criminals, of which there are many. It means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement. It means very strong protection for the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. It means support for the forgotten men and women who have been taken advantage of for so many years. They were doing great. They were doing great before that horrible thing from China came in and hit us, and now they’re starting to do really well again.
Donald Trump: (51:06)
If you think about it, we built the economy twice. We built it then, and then like every other country in the world, it went down, and then we built it again. Now it’s higher in many ways, certainly in the stock market, it’s higher in many ways than it was before. That’s because of the foundation, and no country comes even close to competing with our comeback. It means a strong military and taking care of our vets, but a strong military, which we have totally rebuilt. We have rebuilt it. Our military has never been stronger than it is today. It was tired. It was depleted. It was obsolete. Now we have the best brand-new equipment ever made, and it was all produced right here in the USA. Isn’t that nice? We take care of our vets. We had a poll recently just before leaving office. The vets had a 91% approval rating for the way we took care of them. That’s the highest number in the history of the polls, the vet polls.
Donald Trump: (52:16)
On top of all of that, we have even created the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military in nearly 75 years. The mission of the Democrat party is to promote socialism. They want to promote socialism, ultimately leading, unfortunately, to communism, and that will happen. If you look at Venezuela, you look at some of these countries, that’s why some of our biggest supporters are from South America, Latin America, because they’ve seen what goes on with all of this cancel culture, and you can’t speak, and let’s cut them off and let’s not give them words. The mission of our movement and of the Republican party must be to create a future of good jobs, strong families, safe communities, a vibrant culture, and a great nation for all Americans, and that’s what we’re creating.
Donald Trump: (53:17)
Their party is based upon unvarnished disdain for America, its past and its people. You see that happening. It’s horrible the way they treat the legacy of our country, the culture of our country. Our party is based on love for America and the belief that this is an exceptional nation, blessed by God. We take great pride in our country. We teach the truth about history. We celebrate our rich heritage and national traditions. We honor George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and all national heroes, and of course, we respect our great American flag.
Donald Trump: (54:24)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Audience: (54:48)
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.
Donald Trump: (54:48)
Thank you.
Audience: (54:48)
We love you. We love you. We love you.
Donald Trump: (54:48)
Thank you very much, so nice.
Audience: (54:49)
We love you.
Donald Trump: (54:51)
I started that hearing… Really, we’re getting word of that, hearing that during some of the rallies, especially the latter rallies, where we set records. We had 56 unbelievable packed rallies, and nobody’s ever had anything like we had. We started hearing, “We love you.” I asked somebody, because we really liked Ronald Reagan. He was a great President. We had others, but I said, “Did anybody ever say that to Ronald Reagan or to any of our great…” and to the best of all of these political professionals’ knowledge and pollsters’, nobody’s ever heard that chant before, Matt, so it’s an honor. Believe me, it’s an honor. It’s a great honor. It’s a great honor. When you think about, we love you, you say that about, I hate to say it, am I a politician? I don’t know. Maybe I’m a politician. I hate to admit it, but that’s really… It’s an honor that you would say it.
Donald Trump: (55:48)
We believe in patriotic education and strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America’s youth. It’s horrible. We are committed to defending innocent life and to upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our founders and of our founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctives, and we reject left-wing lunacy, and in particular, we reject cancel culture.
Donald Trump: (56:40)
We know that the rule of law is the ultimate safeguard. We affirm that the Constitution means exactly what it says, as written, as written. They want to change it. They want to change it. They want to get rid of it, frankly. We believe in law and order. We believe that the men and women of law enforcement are heroes who truly deserve our absolute support. We don’t defund the police. We are not defunding the police. We believe in standing up to China, shutting down, outsourcing, bringing back our factories and supply chains and ensuring that America, not China, dominates the future of the world. That’s what’s going to happen. By the way, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China during my administration, hundreds. They never gave us 25 cents. It was a one-way street. We took in hundreds of billions. During negotiations, they would say, “Look, the one thing, we don’t want any more of these tariffs, these tariffs.” Those tariffs, we took in so much money, and what happened is, they became competitive. What happened with people, they wouldn’t go to China. They’d build a lot of it back in our country. They would make it here instead. In addition to that, we were taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars from China. But in all fairness to China, we made a trade deal with them. This was prior to COVID. Once COVID happened, I no longer cared so much about the trade deal, because what happened with that was just disgraceful.
Donald Trump: (58:21)
But that’s one of the things, that’s one of the reasons that right now our farmers are doing so good. I used to tell China, “Look, look, go and get a lot of wheat. Get a lot of different things, all of the things we just talked about, you better go out and do it, because this country has not been treated fairly by you for many, many years, many, many years.” We used to lose $504 billion trade deficit with China, 504, not million. $504 million is a lot, right? You know that through the World Health Organization. Now take 504 million and make it $504 billion, we had deficits with China. It was absolutely insane that this could keep going. It’s amazing that you still have a country left.
Donald Trump: (59:06)
The people that did this to our country, they should be ashamed of themselves. They should be ashamed of themselves. Companies that leave America to create jobs in China and other countries that have ripped us off for years should not be rewarded. They should be tariffed, fined and punished. They should not be rewarded. That’s what the Biden administration is doing. But of course, as you know, they have a very close, personal relationship with China, so I don’t expect much to happen. It’s a shame, because it really is a threat. It’s a tremendous economic threat. Thank God we’ve rebuilt our military, but it’s a tremendous economic threat. Never forget it. These are the convictions that define our movement today and must define the Republican party in the years ahead. Very simple, it’s really quite simple, isn’t it?
Donald Trump: (01:00:07)
Another one of the most urgent issues facing the Republican party is that of ensuring fair, honest and secure elections. Such a disgrace, such a disgrace, such a disgrace. We must pass comprehensive election reforms, and we must do it now. The Democrats used the China virus as an excuse to change all of the election rules without the approval of their state legislatures, making it therefore illegal and had a massive impact on the election. Again, you have to go to the legislatures to get these approvals. This alone would have easily changed the outcome of the election at levels that you wouldn’t have even believed. Even with COVID, even with all of the things, the numbers are staggering. We can never let this or other abuses of the 2020 election be repeated or happen again, can never let that happen again. You see what’s going on. We’ve been set back so greatly with other countries and with the world. We need election integrity and election reform immediately. Republicans should be the party of honest elections that can give everyone confidence in the future of our country. Without honest elections, who has confidence? Who has confidence? This issue is being studied and examined. But the reality is you cannot have a situation where ballots are indiscriminately pouring in from all over the country, tens of millions of ballots. Where are they coming from? They’re coming all over the place, where illegal aliens and dead people are voting, and many other horrible things are happening that are too voluminous to even mention, but people know.
Donald Trump: (01:02:20)
I mean, it’s being studied, and the level of dishonesty is not to be believed. We have a very sick and corrupt electoral process that must be fixed immediately. This election was rigged, and the Supreme Court and other courts didn’t want to do anything about it.
Audience: (01:02:39)
You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won.
Donald Trump: (01:02:39)
We did.
Audience: (01:02:39)
You won. You won. You won. You won.
Donald Trump: (01:03:09)
If you just take that one element where they didn’t go through legislatures, it’s illegal. You can’t do it. It’s in the Constitution. They didn’t have the courage, the Supreme Court. They didn’t have the courage to act, but instead, used process and lack of standing. I was told the President of the United States has no standing. It’s my election. It’s your election. We have no standing. If you’re think of it, we had almost 20 states go into the Supreme Court so that we didn’t have a standing problem. They rejected it. They rejected it. They should be ashamed of themselves for what they’ve done to our country. They didn’t have the guts or the courage to make the right decision. They didn’t want to talk about it. You had the case led by the great State of Texas. 18 states went in, “You don’t have standing. Oh, let’s not talk about it.” They didn’t have the guts to do what should be done, and that’s on top of all of the other forms of cheating. But this is the most basic of all, they would have local courts and local politicians change the rules, in some cases, a day or two before the election. This should never be allowed to happen to another presidential candidate or presidential race, should never be allowed to happen.
Donald Trump: (01:04:43)
Today I want to outline the steps that we must take to have an election system in this country that is honest, fair and accurate. We need one election day, not 45, 30, one day like it’s been. The Republicans don’t get this and the other things I’m going to say, that you should, like the Supreme Court, be ashamed of yourselves. One day, one day, and the only people that should be allowed to vote by mail are people that can be proven to be either very sick, or out of the country, or military where they can’t do it. One day. They have millions and millions of ballots sitting around all over the place for long periods of time. Gee, I wonder what happens with those ballots? I wonder what happens? It’s common sense. It’s a disgrace. It’s an absolute disgrace. There should be a legitimate reason for someone to vote absentee, has to have a reason. We should eliminate the insanity of mass and very corrupt mail-in voting.
Donald Trump: (01:06:03)
We must have voter ID, voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, when they had the convention, you needed voter ID. You needed an ID card. You couldn’t get in unless you had an ID. So many people told me you can’t get in that place. You need ID. Nobody had ID. You need voter ID. They know that. There’s a con job. They’re conning everybody. They know that. They know the wall was good. They knew the wall would work, but they didn’t want to have it, because we wanted it. I made one big mistake in the wall. I should have said, “We will not have a wall.” Then they would have said, “Let’s build a wall.” I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. I’m sorry. It took us a year and a half extra. Because of that mistake, we will not have a wall. “We need a wall immediately,” said Chuck Schumer.
Donald Trump: (01:07:13)
We need universal signature matching. They want to pass a bill where you don’t have to match signatures, where signatures don’t mean anything. Now they know it, just like with the wall, just like with voter ID, when you need to go into anything that’s Democrat run, you need it. But for voting, which is our most sacred institution, you don’t. They don’t want to let you have it. There should be a 100% requirement to verify the citizenship of every person who votes, and there must be a chain of custody protections for every ballot, every ballot. You saw what happened in Detroit and Philadelphia and many other places, swing states mostly, all over, but swing states mostly. You saw what happened? You saw what was going on.
Donald Trump: (01:08:13)
You saw that more people… You take a look at the votes. When you have more votes than you have people, that’s a problem, right? Is that a problem? We have a little problem adjusting in Detroit. We seem to have more votes than we have people, a lot more votes, an election-changing number. We’re not talking about a number where you catch… No, these are election-changing numbers. In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting. What’s that all about? What’s that all about? Cheating, they say. Yeah, I’d say so.
Donald Trump: (01:08:50)
In the history of our country, and it has taken place for years in Pennsylvania, in Detroit and various other places, but there’s tremendous, never like this, because they used COVID as a way of cheating. That’s what happened, and everybody knows it. Hundreds of thousands and millions of ballots, they used it as a way of getting what they’ve wanted for many years, and the Republicans have to do something about it. They’d better do something about it. Our election process is worse than that, in many cases, of a third-world country. You know that. You saw what was going on.
Donald Trump: (01:09:26)
Even if you consider nothing else, it is undeniable that election rules were illegally changed at the last minute in almost every swing state, with the procedures rewritten by local politicians… you’re not allowed to do that… and local judges. They want more time. They want this. They want that. All done by local politicians or local judges, as opposed to state legislatures as required by the Constitution of the United States. These are numbers that are massive. These aren’t little numbers. These are numbers that in each state is a transformative number. It changes the outcome of the election, and it’s not close. Regardless of your political views, this should concern you as a constitutional matter. The Supreme court, again, didn’t have the guts or the courage to do anything about it, and neither did other judges.
Donald Trump: (01:10:24)
Democrats even admitted in Time Magazine, which is I would say on the liberal side, that they couldn’t… They couldn’t hold it in. They had to brag about it, because what they did, they had a brag about it. They couldn’t do it. You got to read this story. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster for our country that we can allow something so corrupt to happen. Read that article. I really encourage you. You read that article.
Donald Trump: (01:10:52)
Yet all of the election integrity measures in the world will mean nothing if we don’t have free speech. That’s where we’re at now. If Republicans can be censored for speaking the truth and calling out corruption, we will not have democracy, and we will have only left-wing tyranny. We can do this. We can do this. We’re smarter than they are. We’re tougher than they are. For some reason, we just don’t. We don’t get it done. We let them attack our businesses, and we don’t attack their businesses. I believe your numbers are bigger than their numbers, but you’re nicer than they are. You’re not as vicious as they are.
Donald Trump: (01:11:35)
In the past, we would debate. I would have it. I’d debate. You’ve seen me for many years. They’d throw something. I debate. They debate. Who knows who wins. People go. They vote. They see what happens, but they would have an idea. They would disagree. The public would hear it. The debate and discourse would take place, and then somebody would make a decision. You would win. You would lose. The public would make up its mind. But now there is no debate, because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard.
Donald Trump: (01:12:03)
There is no debate because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard. They don’t want debate, because we have easy victories in a debate, very easy victories. It’s is called common sense. It’s called other things, but it’s called common sense. So they don’t want a debate. The time has come to break up big tech monopolies and restore fair competition. Republicans, conservatives must open up our platforms and repeal section 230 liability protections. And if the federal government refuses to act, then every state in the union where we have the votes, which is a lot of them, big tech giants, like Twitter, Google, and Facebook should be punished with major sanctions whenever they silence conservative voices. And governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and in Texas and in other States are doing this. If they do what they’re doing, Florida, and that legislation will pass. And Texas and others will have tremendous power to do what’s right and what’s fair.
Donald Trump: (01:13:33)
We have no time to waste, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are racing to pass a flagrantly unconstitutional attack on the first amendment and the integrity of our elections known as HR 1. Do you know what HR 1 is? It’s a disaster. Their bill would drastically restrict political speech, empower power the federal government to shut down decent. And turn the Federal Election Commission into a partisan political weapon. In addition, it virtually eliminates voter ID requirements nationwide, effectively ends all registration deadlines. Can you believe this? Requires States to give ballots to felons, automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote, and puts unaccountable unelected bureaucrats in charge of drawing congressional districts. That’s going to be a lot of fun. This monster must be stopped. It cannot be allowed to pass. Now more than ever is the time for tough strong and energetic Republican leaders who have spines of steel. We need strong leadership. We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media, and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country. Instead of attacking me and more importantly the voters of our movement, top establishment Republicans in Washington should be spending their energy in opposing Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and the Democrats. I’ve said to some of them, I said, “You know, during the Obama years, and now during Biden, if you spent the same energy on attacking them, you’d actually be successful as you do on attacking me, in many cases.” The Democrats don’t have grandstanders like Mitt Romney, little Ben Sasse, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey, and in the house, Tom Rice, South Carolina, Adam Kinzinger, Dan Newhouse, Anthony Gonzalez. That’s another beauty. Fred Upton, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Peter Meyer, John Katko, David Valadao. And of course the warmonger, a person that loves seeing our troops fighting, Liz Cheney. How about that? The good news is in her state, she’s been censured, and in her state, her poll numbers have dropped faster than any human being I’ve ever seen. So hopefully they’ll get rid of her with the next election. Get rid of them all. Democrats are vicious. Remember this, it’s true. Democrats are vicious.
Donald Trump: (01:16:52)
He said evil, well, there is evil there, but they’re vicious, they’re smart, and they do one thing. You got to hand it to them. They always stick together. You don’t have Mitt Romney’s in the group. They always stick together. Fortunately, for the Republican party, the Democrats have horrible policies like open borders, sanctuary cities, defunding the police, and the ridiculous, totally ridiculous green new deal. So, they stick together, they’re smart. They’re vicious, they got everything going, but their policies are no good. So hence, we have, congratulations, the Republican party. After this, they may not stick with those policies. We have to be careful. No, their policies are horrible. Think of it, defund the police. How did that work out? But if Republicans do not stick together, the rhinos that we’re surrounded with will destroy the Republican party and the American worker, and will destroy our country itself, the rhinos, Republican in name only, but the Republican party is united. The only division is between a handful of Washington DC establishment political hacks, and everybody else all over the country.
Donald Trump: (01:18:19)
I think we have tremendous unity. When you look at the crowds outside that want your seats so badly, they will take your seat in two seconds. They want your seat. Congratulations. Congratulations on getting in by the way. I’m very impressed. And that’s why I’m announcing that I will be actively working to elect strong, tough and smart Republican leaders.
Crowd: (01:18:44)
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
Donald Trump: (01:19:13)
Speaking of that, I heard Jim Jordan did a great job. Right? Thank you. I heard that from Mark Meadows. I heard it, oh, there he is. Look at that. Hi Jim. I heard you were great. In fact, I hated to follow you. I want to follow other people. I could name them too. I like to follow other people. I heard you were great. Thank you Jim, very much. Jim Jordan. A great, great athlete. People don’t know he was a great wrestler, tremendous numbers of victories. He was a champion. He was college champion for a long period of time. He’s a winner and a leader and he doesn’t play games. He likes to win. He likes to win. And we have a lot of people in our party that like to win Jim, right? But I heard you were great, thank you very much. But we want Republican leaders who are loyal to the voters and who will work proudly for the vision that I’ve laid out today. And what is it? So simple, right? So simple, military, law and order, great trade deals, great education. So simple.
Donald Trump: (01:20:18)
I don’t, does anybody get it? What are they doing? Does anybody get it? It has just been stated that President Trump’s endorsement is the most powerful asset in politics. Do you believe that? Who would’ve thought that was going to happen? Who would have thought that’s going to happen, Jim? In last year’s congressional primaries, 120, listen to this, it’s crazy. 120 of 122 candidates I endorsed won, 120. That’s almost as good as Jim’s wrestling record. And the two that lost were beaten by people claiming to be more Trump than their opponent. So I like those two people very much also. In the Senate, I was undefeated in endorsements with a record of 21 and 0, my endorsement of Mitch McConnell, at his request-
Crowd: (01:21:16)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (01:21:16)
It’s all right, it’s all right. Now, he made a request. He asked for my endorsement, brought him from one point down to 20 points up, and he won his race in the great state, and actually the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. And he won it very easily. And I said, “I wonder if I’m doing the right thing here.” But you know what? I did what I did. But he went from one point down to 20 points up very quickly, immediately actually. And he won his race. And if you compare that to his other elections, I’m sure you’ll see something interesting. But you know what? We got a Republican elected. And now we have to use Republicans to take care of the election frauds and all of the other things that are happening that shouldn’t be allowed to happen in our country. It’s very simple. Because of my efforts campaigning, we had huge gains in the House, and I helped keep many senators in their seats, and they will admit it, so that it’s now 50/50, instead of Republicans being down anywhere from eight to 10 seats.
Donald Trump: (01:22:25)
And they’ll admit it, we’d be down eight to 10 seats if I didn’t campaign. We held rallies for some of the senators that were down. And nobody talks about that. Nobody wants to talk, the press doesn’t talk about it. With me at the top of the ticket, not a single Republican member of Congress lost their race for the first time in decades. We won 26 of 26 toss up races. Toss up. Think of that, 26 of 20, and those are toss up. Those are races that could go any way. We were expected to lose 25 seats, and instead we won 15 seats, and almost, oh, why couldn’t we have done a couple of more, almost cost crazy Nancy her job. We’ll do that the next time around. I received almost, listen to this number, because you know, the fake news doesn’t ever talk about these numbers. I just heard this one for the first time. I received almost 1.5 million more votes than all of the Republican House candidates combined.
Donald Trump: (01:23:34)
So how the hell is it possible that we lost? It’s not possible. I got more votes. I got more, which is me, when I say I, I’m talking about we. We, we got more votes than any incumbent, any incumbent president in the history of our country, almost 75 million votes. And that doesn’t include the votes and ballots they threw out. If you include them, you’ll see numbers that are much different. We did even better in the second election than we did in the first, you know I won the first? And we won the second, we did much better. Sort of strange, right? How did you do? Well, we did much better the second time. Oh, you did? Really? What a disgrace, what a disgrace to our country. I got over 11 million, very close to 12 million more votes than we got in 2016. And I was told by John McLaughlin that if you, the great pollster, that if you get to, we had 63 in 2016, 63 million.
Donald Trump: (01:24:39)
Sir, if you get to 66 million, you have it made. We got to almost 75 million. Then what the hell happened? What happened? What happened when they closed all of the counting booths? What happened at 3:00 in the morning? What happened at 3:02 in the morning? What happened? No president has ever lost an election after carrying Florida, Ohio, and Iowa. And I won them all. And I won them by a lot. By a lot. I won 94% of the primary vote, no incumbent president who received more than 75% of the primary vote has ever lost an election. I had a record number, and no president has ever, ever, and we’re talking about a much lower number than we got, has ever lost an election. Thanks to my coattails, thank you. We have to have a sense of humor. Thanks to my coattails, democrats failed to flip a single state legislature. Think of it, or a legislative chamber, because Republicans came out to vote for me. Now they say it differently. The press, the fake news spins it differently.
Donald Trump: (01:25:58)
They say, “Despite how well they did, Trump didn’t win.” That’s such a lie. And many legislators, many legislators told me, they said, they were going to lose their race. It wasn’t going to happen. And then what happened is one in particular told me from a great swing state, said, “You know, I thought I was going to lose my position, lose my race. And I went out with my wife the night before the election. And I saw all these Trump signs and the American flags and the spirits on the streets.” I said, “You know, darling, I think we’re going to win.” He said, “But you were far, far, far more popular than me.” They do lots of polls. You were way, way ahead of me, sir. And the next day I was right. He said, he won the election by a lot, and you lost the election. And sir, it’s not possible that you lost, because you got a lower number than I did. And you were so far ahead of me. You’re the person that brought everybody out to vote.
Donald Trump: (01:26:57)
And I happen to agree with that 1, 000%. never forget that conversation. He couldn’t believe it. And I’ve heard it from more than one. And in November, 18 of 19 bellwether counties, you heard about the bellwether counties? 18 of 19 bellwether counties that have correctly predicted every presidential election election for decades. Many decades, voted for Trump, not for Biden. And it was a shocker to those people that go for the stats. It was a shocker. They voted for Trump, 18 of 19 voted for Trump. There’s never been anything like that. And yet did Biden win? No. If you want to help us take back the future of our country, go to DonaldJTrump.com. I don’t do this. I’ve never done this, but it’s time that we have to put forces together, because these people with their big tech and their fake news media right back there, okay? And you know, when you talk about election, they turn off.
Donald Trump: (01:28:04)
When you talk about, they probably have them going, because they also care about ratings. But when they talk about election, they turn off the cameras. You know why? It’s a very sore subject, okay? They don’t like that subject. There’s only one way to contribute to our efforts, to elect America first Republican conservatives, and in turn to make America great again, and that’s through Save America, PAC, and DonaldJTrump.com. So go out there and do whatever you can because we’re going to help a lot of great people. We know the right people to help. We need your help to win, and to fight big tech and the radical left and the DC establishment. We need to save your second amendment, which is under siege. We need to help protect funding for our military and for our great vets. And that’s what we’re doing. As we discussed earlier, we’re in a struggle for the survival of America as we know it. This is a struggle. This is a terrible, terrible, painful struggle. The path ahead will not be easy, but we will win. We are going to win. Ultimately we always win.
Donald Trump: (01:29:11)
And when we do, history will show that this was the moment when we could have given up, when we could have despaired. But instead, we chose to keep on pushing forward. The greater the challenge and tougher the task, the more determined we must be to pull through to triumph. We have to have triumph. We have to have victory. With the talent and dedication of everyone here today, and you have tremendous, not only dedication, tremendous talent in this room. I know many of you. That is exactly what we will do. We will go on to victory. We will summon the spirit of generations of American Patriots before us, like those heroes who crossed the Delaware, conquered the Rockies, stormed the beaches, won the battles, and tamed the unknown frontiers. We will persist, and we will prevail. We’re tougher than they are. We’re stronger than they are. Together, in the coming years, we will carry forward the torch of American Liberty. We will lead the conservative movement and the Republican party back to a totally conclusive victory.
Donald Trump: (01:30:26)
And we’ve had tremendous victories. Don’t ever forget it. With your help, we will take back the House. We will win the Senate. And then, a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be? I wonder who that will be? Who, who, who will that be? I wonder. Standing before you today, I am supremely confident that for our movement, for our party, and for our country, our brightest days are just ahead. And that together we will make America prouder, freer, stronger and greater than it ever has been before. Thank you CPAC, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you.
